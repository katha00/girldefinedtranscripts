Today on the girl to find show we are talking about what to do when you feel like you have taken every step toward finding freedom from a sexual sin sexual addiction and you're like. I just can't find freedom i was actually talking to a young woman the other day and she was saying like i've read sex period i've listened to all your podcast like i've done all the things but i can't kick this in like what do i do and so we want to bring you some fresh biblical truth some encouragement to help you know that hope is possible freedom is possible you do not have to stay stuck in this sexual sin like there is freedom in christ and we are going to bring you some truths that will give you steps toward finding freedom and christ starting today hey google we are sisters and the founders of girl to find ministries and we are so glad you're joining us for this conversation today because you know. If you've been here for any amount of time that we're passionate about understanding god's design for biblical womanhood and a huge part of our womanhood that is often not talked about in christian circles is our sexuality and that means our sexual struggles are desires are longings are brokenness our pain or all of that that is all a part of what we need to talk about as christian women because there are so many areas that were wrestling in and we need hope and we need truth and so one of the things that i remember really struggling in and feeling like can i ever find freedom will i ever find freedom from this sexual sin was my struggle of masturbation and in our book sex purity and the longings of a girl's heart i write about my journey my repeated failure and feeling like many of you are will i ever be free will i ever have a time in my life where i'm looking back as a conqueror of my sexual and not a continuous struggler right doesn't mean we're perfect but we can look back and say god is giving me victory over that particular habitual sin god has done that in my life and i know i'm confident based on god's word that he can do that in your life too now if you haven't read our book you're like this episode is going to be really helpful but i haven't actually read sex purity and the longest of a girl's heart this is the perfect place to start cuz this is really square one like. Understanding the foundation of god's design for us as women as sexual beings the fact that lust is a woman's problem too not just a man's problem understanding lies that we buy into because culture says certain things are normal but then we look in god's word and see actually that's contrary to god's design for us so renewing our mind with truth we unpack all of that in this book and so i encourage you if you've never read it i know i am confident this will be a huge help and encouragement in your journey and you can find this girl to find calm slash shop and the other thing we actually have some free resources they're free technically if you are a part of our patreon family and i mean check these out just to printable down notable pdfs battling sexual temptation a biblical tool kit for christian women and then five strategies to find freedom from sexual sin these are like i said downloadables and you'll get instant access to these and doesn't of other free resources when you join our support team over at patreon.com to find because that support team you guys are literally the backbone of girl fighting you enable us financial in so many ways to do what we're doing bringing you content like this so if you're like yeah i have an extra four or five bucks a month i could totally give that to a ministry that i want to link arms with cuz i believe in this message i want this message to get out there then please turn on over to patreon.com / girl define you can get access to all the freebies and you'll support girl to find at the same time. I think as we jump into this conversation about like feeling like you've done everything you have done everything or maybe you are someone who's trying to help a friend or a mentee or someone and you're like i feel like i've done everything and we're just not making progress or they're just isn't freedom that's being found and i think when we get to a place of hopelessness that is one of the worst places we can get because the enemy wants us to feel like we're hopeless there's no like this works for other people is for other people's victory in christ for other people but you're kind of a special case and you aren't it's not possible for you you'll never be that person that's looking back right and saying wow look at the victory that christ had for me and we know that's a lie because they're so many verses in scripture and we know just the basics of the gospel is jesus came to set us free he came to gave us life he came to help us overcome and conquer and so some of the points were going to be bringing you today are fresh and new and driven by people who have been on this journey so we're going to give you some great resource recommendations of people who have been to incredibly hard sexual struggles who have different stories different reasons for when and how and why they entered these struggles but they are someone who has found freedom and christ and they're now able to look back and encourage others along the way so i am so pumped for this episode because i just the truth and the resources and the direction you're going to get are incredible but we need you to know. That there is hope. And we need you to know that it's like don't give up but don't don't quit don't give up we actually interviewed someone on the podcast in episode 50 and she shared her entire story of. Just she had a lot of difficult things that have happened to her choices she made how that impacted her marriage i mean just so much stuff with sexual addiction in her own life even after marriage and how she overcame that in christ and she even has a resource that will link below and we'll talk about it again in a little bit but she is a woman who. Things that she has said that will be super super encouraging to you but we just want to start off on that note. Specifically focuses her whole entire ministry authentic intimacy is focused around the the god's design for sexuality and helping women specifically find freedom so another great resource authentic intimacy but i love how she talks about how healing and finding freedom takes the body of christ you mentioned that the enemy wants us to think that we are beyond repair that we are beyond redemption we are beyond god's forgiveness and grace and victory and so with the enemy does is he gets us to believe that lie and then he wants us to feel like we're on an island right we are isolated we are alone because somehow we believe this is unique to us and we're never going to find freedom we don't reach out and engage with other people we just kind of struggle alone or on this island and that's exactly where the enemy wants us because then we're trapped there but god has a much better a different plan for us and that is that freedom from sexual sin can be found within community and dr julie slattery talks about this she says here's a direct quote you will never heal by yourself. Never. And i would even go so far as to say you're not likely to heal with just you and god. God works through his body and that means sharing this journey with other people. And then jonathan doherty also another amazing man who has a ministry be broken and it's just an incredible resource for men and women all about the broke like the humility that heart posture of humility that brokenness of saying were broken were coming before the lord he is the one who ultimately kills us he also talks about community saying the more we engage in community it becomes far easier to persevere and so i think right off the bat you know if we could all just kind of raise our hands those of us who are tempted to isolate ourselves to fight these battles on our own. This is a call and a reminder the very first step to not do this alone you know galatians talks about bearing one another's burdens like this is a huge burden that can feel so overwhelming and so isolating we have to be the ones to take those steps we can't expect people just to know what we're struggling with to be able to just look into our eyes and know i'm going to reach out to this girl because she has the struggle no we have to engage in community confess our sins be open and then as we persevere in that biblical christian community there is so much freedom through the body of christ that can be had so with thinking about it it's not an overnight thing like okay i'm gonna jump into a church or i'm going to jump into a small group and all my problems and since struggles are going to go away like this is a long-term process and we have to be in it for the long haul especially if you are someone who's like i've tried everything i done all the things and i have just prayed my brains out and i am just still not free so one of the steps that you can take is thinking okay how can i get involved in a really intentional really biblically based community whether that's a small group at church or an accountability group or me and two or three other women where we are having this really intentional mentorship how can i get involved in that sort of community because there are communities. Where you're surrounded by people but right like you know it's more just like yeah potluck friends hanging out surface conversations and you're like. How would i ever have an opportunity to share my sexual struggles in this setting so you're right that is a key point it needs to be the right kind of community where you're actually living that life on life biblical one another's hours and people who are not going to be awkward or embarrassed or like right away thanks for sharing let's move on you know like people who are like yes like we want to help we want to pray we want to support so you want to see how that kind of community that you can be in long-term not just temporary another thing that you want to do when it comes to like the body of christ like we heard you read from julie slaughtering to seek out some really intentional counseling and one of my favorite resources is the association of certified biblical counselors you can just go to biblical counseling.com i have personally seen a biblical counselor through them she was amazing and i know many people who have and they're just incredible counselors and the coolest part is that many of them are actually free and they do have a ministry and so that seeking out a godly woman you can literally just go on to their website biblical counseling.com and you can look in your area and see if there are any local counselors and if you're like they're not in my area you can find one and a lot of them are willing to like zoom or do something online with you so that they can still cancel you so you have that small group that church community that you're really plugged into you have that intentional counseling in your life someone who isn't like who who understands how to help you take those steps toward freedom and in this area there's no excuses since these things are free so far the barrier is small and like you said it doesn't even have to be someone in your city if you're like i live in a tiny little town there are there's like nothing here again and the internet which gives you access to the entire world so that's a huge thing that can be. Anyone who is interested in a specific topic or a specific aspect of sexuality like whether it's women who are wanting to find freedom from pornography or you know they have these different kind of like niche categories so they actually have a book study that they work through regularly so each time they have these books study that you can sign up for there's a leader within the group and you're getting to know other people who are kind of walking on the same journey as you and wanting to find freedom so one that they regularly offer is a book study and it's actually written by jonathan doherty grace based recovery grace based recovery is the name of the book and it's a 10 weeks small group study designed to help people suffering from addiction and those close to them understand god's grace and why is the only path to true freedom. Strongholds of addiction in our lives so this is exactly what we're talking about we're talking about for those of you who said i tried all the things you've done all the things how do i find freedom this is a way for you to be in community for you to be walking with other believers people who are saying i am humbling myself enough to admit i need help and then this is what this resource and this small group leader will take you through 10 weeks of intentional accountability working through this book helping you find freedom so those three things we just listed the church the acbc the biblical counseling and then this book study those are three things i bet a lot of you haven't tried yet so that's some fresh hope some fresh start doing. And i think you're hearing whoa this is kind of like a big deal and that is the thing is that we often have these sins these habitual sins that we are struggling in we're trapped and we're believing lies in and then we just kind of do the same old thing every time to fight the same i'm like okay well i prayed which is powerful i read this verse get in scripture but then we're like continuing to fall into the same things and make the same mistakes and more like why why can't i accomplish lasting change why isn't god changing my heart maybe you need to seek different methods different tools maybe god wants to use something that feels kind of like the big guns right like you're bringing in the big guns because your recognizing it is time for me to get really serious not just kind of casually fighting this in not just semi intentionally but like this is on the forefront of my agenda for every single day like this is my priority i am tired of falling prey to this and over and over i am going to bring in that community get a nice you know amazing grace gospel centered groups and i am going to pursue lasting change and it's going to require sacrifice it's going to require time it may require finances but you're willing to do it because you are ready you're like i am ready to make this commitment god please help me i do finally want to be free and so yeah it's not a passive thing it is a very intentional very proactive thing. The other thing that is so important to recognize is that you could do all of these things that bethany just talked about you could take all of these steps and it could be in more of a like let me just get the check box like okay check i got in a small group check i'm doing the actions i'm going through the motions but your heart isn't really in it and if you believe the lie that somehow just checking the box and going through these motions even taking an amazing course based on finding freedom from sexual sin but you're not seeking the lord in your heart to say god change my heart change my desires then you may very well come out on the other side of doing all of these amazing things that find yourself right back in the same place because healing and finding freedom it only begins as god changes our heart and changes our desires and changes the focus of our worship at the core of our heart and joyce cargo we talked about before. She says there is so much more to healing than just not looking at pornography like struggling with erotica masturbation a sexual relationship texting whatever you're struggling with there's so much more to healing than just not doing that thing right. So much of this is about our heart and i believe it is that's where it starts truly we don't want to just change our behavior we need to change our heart. Because if we just change behavior then the same triggers the same since the same patterns struggles are just going to cause us to do other things so we may stop let's say for one woman it's pornography she finds she's like okay i'm not looking at pornography but her heart hasn't actually been changed her desires or affections for the lord the true object of her worship still she still has some idolatry she doesn't even realize it and so that pornography that sexual sin is just going to shift to something different and it may not even be sexual it could be something else that she begins to idolize or chase after because her heart hasn't truly been changed and so that is that is to me in this conversation like he going before the lord and regularly asking him to change your heart and how do we do this again some of these things seemed so simple like wait i've heard all of these things before but are we truly pursuing these with the power of christ saying god help me to walk in this space every single day front priority for me in my life regular prayer. That regular community with god you know we often talk about prayer but how much do we actually pray like how much do we pay yesterday the day before the week before we talked about the power of prayer often as christians but then it can be so hard to do something that's so. God almighty the one who sent his son jesus to die on the cross to free us from the bondage and power of sin that is the same god that we're going to in prayer and crying out to him god loves to hear the genuine cries of his children and he wants to meet us but we have to be intentional to go before the lord involvement in a small group like you were talking about getting in that group that life on life genuine believers where you're able to share and not just getting in the group and then kind of shying away from really sharing but asking god for the boldness through prayer to say god help me to be authentic to actually share my struggles even if i'm trembling my hands are shaking i remember being terrified the first time i confessed openly my struggle with masturbation it's so scary. But on the other side of sharing there is so much freedom because that darkness we've been living in has now been exposed and now we're walking in the light and god uses that light to bring freedom well and i just want to jump on top of that because we i just finished a like online bible study with a bunch of women and the first week we had a week where we talked about like sexual sin and sexual struggle and one of the ladies in the group decided that she was going to share about her sexual struggle for the first time like. Publicly and she shared about it she said about it first like in the chat and then in her private group and it was just amazing to see just even like the hope and the just the bondage that was lifted just with that first step of faithfulness into the light as terrified as she was and then it enabled other people to like wow if she's going to be that brave and bold i can do this too while i was like a trickle effect and so you don't even know there might be someone else who is struggling as someone who can come alongside and say i'm going to fight this with you i get it so there's just so much more that can happen when you bring this into the light rather than. I'm curious what how did she bring it into the light like in the group cuz i'm sure anybody listening or watching might be thinking okay yeah i want to do that but i don't even know what to say like was there like how did you bring it up. Shared. Face-to-face i guess with all of us on zoom and she was just you know really terrified and she was crying and it was really hard for her to get the words out and she just basically said that she. I never shared this with anyone and she was really scared but she really knew that if she didn't do it now when was she going to do it well you know and so she said she shared the specific struggle that she was struggling with and that she was really committed to. I want to do this because i know this will give me the courage to now take that next step and it's almost like a snowball like it's like wow yes it is. So yeah that's so great and you know what if you're like i don't know what to say i'm not someone good with words you can even write it out and you could even just write out a few simple sentences like how do i want to share this with my small group of ladies you know right out just a sentence like. Hey guys this is something i've been praying about for a long time something really hard for me but i know that god wants me to share this with you so. Accountable is you could. You know not share what you're going to share but send a text to that mentor or to that group is a great idea i've been praying about something i feel really convicted about this i need to share something with the group in person please keep me accountable to sharing this because i don't want to check it out you know and ask me when i come to share this thing that i need to share and so then you can know like ok google okay i'm going to do that yes oh okay so now we've given you know there's no excuse me we're genuinely cheering for you praying for you we want to see christian women walk in freedom and we've seen it god do it in our own lives and we want that same heart transformation for you as well so continuing on the theme of god changing our hearts we really have to examine our own hearts and ask do i have a genuine relationship with jesus not just a head knowledge you know yes i understand the gospel i understand genesis to revelation like i read my bible here and there but are we walking are you walking in a genuine relationship with god you know what is that look like for you are you having that fellowship that time where you're not just kind of and i fall into this too like the checkbox like okay got my bible time done check you know read the bible said a quick prayer and now i'm on my way but are you coming with god fellowship in with him opening his word and anticipation thank god teach me when you say those things. Meaning of scott. It sounds so like i know it sounds so fuzzy so to bring it like to put some flush on bones so it's it's simple right it's getting in the word but it's not just so like say in the morning that's your time you're like that i know i need to do it before i get going or it's never going to happen i know that's true for me you get in the word but it's a different heart posture something that i want to do more it's so powerful is to start your time off even reading a song and using it as your prayer so to kind of change your heart posture from one of like okay duty like got to go here's my quiet time let me read it real quick and be on my way to like carve out more time maybe 30 minutes or more where you can not feel rushed you turn off your phone you're not distracted you are coming before god with his word open saying god meet me here i want to know you show me who you are through your word change me by the power of your word as i read this scripture this morning you know i want to walk away from this having fellowship with you lord having been convicted having been encouraged through your word because that's what god's word does but if we're just quick you know he in and out then it's more like fast food it's not going to really do what it's meant to do for us so i love starting with the song when i think to do this and even in this moment i'm like i really want to start doing that now because when i have done it in the past it's been so encouraging you read that song you pray it back to god and it really for me shifts my heart from one of like hurried busy to like. What kind of resting like taking a moment and so that can be a great way to start and then picking a passage working from beginning to end even one chapter a day reading the passage and saying okay god how do i see you in this passage what truths are you teaching me what instruction you know what can i praise you for in this passage and then what do i need to confess what sins am i being convicted of as i'm reading your truth god what sins am i being convicted of lord please i can confess these forgive me so it's really just that intentional fellowship and we already talked about prayer but that leads right into worship. Write that heart of worship where when we're not just doing the quick in and out when we're actually soaking in god's word in prayer there is room to worship god i know people who love to even play it praise and worship songs on their phone at the beginning or at the end of their quiet time just to center their heart on worshiping god as you're driving just taking those moments to say yeah normally i'm just popping in a podcast or i'm just busy busy go go go but i'm going to intentionally throughout my week. Just worship the lord i'm going to play for me music is one of the easiest ways for me to get my heart and not worshipful mode and so that can be something that you incorporate more even if like attempting thought comes into your brain you see that slippery slope going towards sexual sin you know that's kind of how it starts you like nip it okay get a worship song on praise the lord change the direction of your heart's desires to be focused on the lord and then doing these things god will use these things to change our heart okay a few more points for you and like we said this is kind of. There are a lot of things that were recommending and and suggestions but you really. Here are some steps that i know i can take right away but just remembering that freedom it takes perseverance this is not an overnight journey we live in such a fast-paced world like microwave culture where everything is fast fast fast fast fast fast fast fast fast fast fast fast and we want we want freedom now we want that healing now we want that overnight like miraculous transformation and. It takes perseverance it takes faithfulness it takes that step after step of trusting god going through the things that you know you need to do being faithful in the word being faithful in that community is all of those little things that slowly start to change us from the inside out jonathan doherty says god has not called us to perfection or call us to success but he's called us to faithfulness and faithfulness he's with this idea of perseverance so it's just persevering in the face persevering in what you know is right persevering and what you know is true not giving up and that's where having that community will be so helpful when you're feeling so down when you're just like oh what is wrong with me you'll have that community to come alongside you to speak gospel truth to you to help you like you up to say hey we are in this together like you we are here for you so instead of you looking ahead and. Do the same thing one step at a time you don't worry about the whole future all of life's problems and you know where am i going to be in you know even in a year from now like focus on being faithful and persevering. Today i have a great example of you when you were running your marathon so she run a marathon big applause i've never done that but i remember you specifically talking about how every mile as you got further into the race was harder and harder and it was like freezing and you were like wet cuz it was raining and i remember you talking about how the group you were running with you were with like a case group yes and you had a leader and if it hadn't been for that group that you were surrounded by and that leader encouraging you when you were weary when you wanted to give up when you wanted to stop i mean you're seeing the parallels here right as we battle sexual sin it was because of that group that you made it all the way to the finish line and it was it was hard and it was strenuous it didn't happen all at once said works in his spiritual sense when we don't have what it takes cuz we're tired of fighting this battle those around us god uses to keep us moving forward to encourage us to remind us like hey i know you want to give up right now i know you feel like you can't take one more step but you can with god strength you can and so just like running a marathon battling sexual sin is a spiritual marathon with community with encouraging christian mentors and leaders that will help us continue to move forward so wrapping up you know we just want to encourage you to go to the resources we if you haven't read sex purity and the longings of a girl's heart to gain a good biblical view of sex and sexuality and intimacy this is where you want to start this is an incredible step you know you can become a patron in our community like we talked about patreon.com girl to find where you can get access to immediately multiple resources that will help you but i just want to end with a scripture that will just give you so much hope first i want to re-emphasize you know the fact that first john 1:9 says if we confess our sins he god is faithful. And just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness so that's why jesus died there's nothing too big to badge which scary for him like he is the faithful one he will forgive us and cleanse us if we seek. John 15:5 which says i am the vine speaking of god you are the branches whoever abides in me and i and i and him he it is that there's much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing so just remembering that we can't do this on our own it's like you talked about so much we have to be plugged into christ we have to have that that. Intimate fellowship with him that has to be the foundation and then everything else we shared comes from that to remembering he is faithful he is the vine we must be connected to him we'd love to carry on this conversation in the comments so leave a comment let us know how we can encourage you how we can pray for you and we will see you again next week.
