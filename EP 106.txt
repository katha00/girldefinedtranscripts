And whether or not the wedding night is awkward if it's your first time hey sisterhood i'm kristen and i'm bethany and were the founders of girl to find ministries where we are discovering god's radical design for femininity and identity together we are so glad that you are joining us for this episode. We're glad you joined us every week every monday when we come out with new episodes but today's topic is one that we. I can't tell you how many times you've been asked this question on social media through our email girls that i meet in person just like. Tell me they want to know it's like the question that's almost like you can't ask it in like can i ask this. Is it awkward to be a virgin on your wedding night and we're just going to go for it well that's the thing we were talking like before we started recording obviously and i i was thinking i was like you know we could ask this question all the time like is it awkward is it weird and i'm like you know if we're not going to talk about it like where y'all going to go to google i mean you're not going to get great advice there no offense hey google tell me the scoop you know you have a really good friend who's married or you know really close to your mom or aunt or whoever you know so i feel like this is a great. Place to discuss the true issues that we think about because you know. We are talking to you a ton of you who are single obviously there are those of you who are married or you know that we come from different backgrounds and you know we all approach these conversations with a different i guess. Different families and different upbringings and different churches but the one reality is is that we are all on here and we want to learn more about god's design for our lives as women we want to learn more about god's just. So we are going to we're going to go there but we are also going to approach this in a very i guess respectful not like a raunchy crude like we're not going to be vulgar yes so just know that this is going to be a very respectful conversation but we're also going to make sure you get your questions answered so this would be you know if you're someone that's younger and or maybe you're a mom listening up some great conversation if you have little kids in the car maybe you're like maybe this isn't the episode for that but it is going to be an amazing conversation and you know share this with your friends because i guarantee they probably are asking this question i don't know if i've seen anyone else really addressing this like i don't really see too many people like that we'll talk about recommendations that are digging into the nitty gritty but it's not common if you appreciate the fact that we address questions like this like a few weeks ago we had an episode on pornography we talked about biblical womanhood we get into with the bible gets into on this podcast and it's unashamed it's bold but we hope it's gracefield and so relevant for your life today as a christian woman if you appreciate that you have no idea how much it helps this podcast by leaving a review particularly a five-star review it helps us so much because the more reviews the more the analytics are not analytics what's it called like the algorithm that will expose it to more people more women just like you hoping to find biblical truth to encourage them in their walk with christ and so please even as you're listening right now scroll down top five star button leave a quick review tell us why you like this what you want to hear more from on this podcast and it helps us out so much so thank you. And i do want to say really quick cuz just like i mentioned we're all coming from different backgrounds we are coming from different upbringings and in no way are we you know you know answering this question is it awkward being a virgin on your wedding night and and saying you know any of you who have had sex in the past or maybe you're like wow i was 16 and i made a horrible decision is there any hope for me you know we want to start out by saying that there is redemption and forgiveness and god really is the god of second chances and so many ways you know he he knows that we are sinful and humans and that we do we do not always open we do not we don't always obey his word or maybe you aren't a christian for a long time and you're like wow i didn't even understand god's design so i didn't even know that. I had sex with someone who was not my husband please forgive me for that i recognized in your word that that is reserved for marriage and i want to follow you from this day forward in this area and you know what god says that he promises forgiveness when we come to him and when we asked so we can come to this conversation today knowing that there's forgiveness for all of us because all of us come to the table truly you know not perfectly pure or not just you know crushing it it's like we all need his strength his redemption and his forgiveness in our life so let's have humble hearts as we approach this topic and just you know with the goal of striving to you know better live for christ and maybe one day get married and you know love her husband's well and you know really embraced god's design for sex well so i just want to make sure we start with that yeah that's a really really good word okay let's do out for a minute though cuz we're going to share a little bit of each of our personal stories like okay our journeys a lot of you know yeah we were virgins on our wedding night and it was the first time we'd ever had sex. Ever and so we get asked a lot because you know we'll talk about god's design for sexuality marriage and so like people will ask us like we said directly was it awkward like do you regret it but i want to or you want to remind me to take a picture like just to set the tone for like what is it because if we don't always refocus on like the bullseye i've got to sign up for sexuality for sex and intimacy more particularly then it's like yeah we can have this conversation but if we don't get the bigger picture from the get-go like why does it even matter like why is it even a big deal to like just have sex with your husband one day in marriage like what's the point. I've been married and divorced and i find myself in this place and i'm wondering god is there for me or you're the girl who was like yeah i'm fighting for purity i haven't had sex but i'm wondering is it worth it like this is really hard is it worth it like the world's telling me it's not worth it just have fun love it up while you're young but i don't know so or the girl who is you know i think we have a lot of girls who are like well i grew up in a really conservative home and. Truth is something to even be excited about or is this just right you know so i think you're right we have a lot of different person yeah right now okay one thing we know for sure when we open up god's word is that god is not shy when it comes to sex and intimacy. We as christians can sometimes be a little bashful in the church about it so that's why we go to the world for answers cuz we're like i'm not hearing anything from my pastor. God creating a man and a woman we see two genders we see him saying you know adam knew his wife he was intimate be fruitful and multiply we see period for sexual intimacy but we see god from the beginning you know he had their he had a blank slate he could have created anything he wanted and he made a man and a woman sexual beings and then gave them marriage brought them together and then he plays sex with in the boundaries of that beautiful relationship and we don't know all the nuances in genesis right like we can't see the full picture till we see the whole bible that we see oh and the new testament we have passages and ephesians giving us a clearer picture of marriage being a picture of christ in the church it's an earthly mirror pointing us to a greater spiritual reality showing us the true need of our heart in the reflection of the man and the wife the husband is christ and the bride represents the church and it's that picture of christ coming suing his church sacrificing for her that agape love that is the picture of god wants us to show in marriage reflecting god's redemption for humanity the gospel essentially the relationship between christ and his church and then the intimacy that god placed within marriage sexual intimacy is supposed to be according to god's word it's in that covenant and a covenant is the word we don't say a lot like i never really use it except when i'm talking about the google marriage i'm not like talking about it at 10 but really a covenant such a powerful word because what it means is it's a promise so strong it cannot be broken and all throughout scripture we see god saying i'm making a covenant with who with his people with abraham with isaac we see these covenants in the old testament we see this covenant with christ and his people his as he died on the cross redeemed people bridge that gap so we could have that relationship with god again god is saying i'm making a covenant with you my people it's a promise so strong it can't be broken and he got his thing that's what marriage points do marriage is supposed to be a covenant between a husband and wife so strong. That it can't be broken and it's pointing to that love that covenant that god has with his people and then it's only within that covenant that sacred relationship where true intimacy can be experienced can be enjoyed as you enter that union of oneness that that on a physical level in marriage is what god. It's pointing to the gospel to a bigger picture and so we're having that foundation even as we approach this it helps to remind us oh you know if you're the girl wondering like is it worth the wait like it's worth it because you're living for something so much more than yourself you're pointing others to jesus through your sexuality yeah and i think another big aspect of god's design is that you know. But actually truly you do the more you understand god's design the better your intimacy will be in marriage and the reason i say that is because when you think about christ what does the bible says he didn't come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many and he fulfilled his ultimate purpose he said i'd come to do the will of my father how did you fulfill god's will by literally coming and serving and giving up his life and that's how we found life and that's how you know ultimately anyone who comes to him is saved and redeemed and that's what true agape love is it's not coming to be served but to serve to love the other and truly the best intimate relationships are those where you come to the marriage bed and you say i'm not here to be served but to serve the other and when a husband and wife both come to the marriage bed and say i am here to love you to serve you intimacy it sounds weird but that's when you find the most satisfaction because you're not so hyper focused on yourself and what you're getting but i'm giving the other person a wonderful beautiful time in your loving them and saying how can i make this amazing for you and then when they're doing that for you it is the most beautiful romantic special non awkward thing in the world so even down to the heart of christ at the way he loves us if you even take that heart into your bedroom you know the marriage bed on it transforms it and makes it beautiful so you can see just how much even the gospel impacts every area of our life and when you hear people say that like the gospel impacts everything is like tell me how you know that's how because it's that hard and that mindset and i guarantee you like if you are married you're probably like yes that makes so much sense but if you're single like the more you can transform your mind to view things in this lightly if you intimacy through this lens you are going to be so much better prepared than if you didn't ya and that bullseye like you're talking about that heart of the gospel in the bedroom i should be a book that's like what you're saying like oh how do you think everything like that that's not really weird what are you talking about but it's true it's like down to the marriage bed right it's like wow god has so intentional which that should answer the question of why is it a big deal doesn't matter well think about it the world says it's no big deal have sex with whoever you want like it's all about you it's all about your pleasure think about what bethany just explained about it being that self-sacrificing love the world says it doesn't matter you put you first if you feel like go for it yeah that's the opposite of denying oneself for the good of the other at that self-sacrifice i am caring about someone else more than myself. That's the gospel and in marriage sex is a celebration of that covenant commitment right you stood an altar you said till death do us part i'm committing to this person. You're actually living a lie essentially because you're saying i am becoming one with this person but my body is becoming one but my heart is not in this covenant my life is not even in this covenant and so essentially it's a false celebration it's not the real deal which is why it's so destructive it leaves so many chasing that fulfillment following their heart it leaves them empty on the other side because that covenant which is the foundation and what sex is to be celebrated it's not there and so at the end of the day it's just empty pleasure it doesn't last it doesn't feel as god designed it to be in that covenant so there's so many other things we could go into about why god's design is so good so intentional and why sex out of marriage is really like a fish out of water it might seem okay for a few minutes or for like a time but really at the end of the day it's so destructive and so yeah let's get that beautiful picture and the front of our minds yeah right now and you know answer that question that you're all waiting for like okay let's get to it like is being a virgin awkward on your wedding night okay i feel like you have to go first since you got 10 years ago i got married two and a half years ago so i'm still a newbie but i feel like. Yeah so zack and i both grew up with this understanding of sexuality what i'm so grateful for i will say it wasn't like a full understanding i still i'm still learning i still don't fully understand it i don't know if we ever will till we actually you know are in heaven but you know we understood okay god does have a plan for sexuality he has a good purpose for sex it isn't just random it's meant to be celebrated with in a covenant of marriage and so we were both committed to that separately even before we ever met each other and so when we met each other that wasn't an area that we were both like. You know how do you what do you think how do you feel you are you trying to go for it or are you tempting me like are you pushing this like we both knew from the get-go like that's not something we're going to do until we're married with our spouse whether it's you or someone else like it's just not we're not going there and so we had set up boundaries and you know as we got to know each other like just getting to know each other's hearts and building that friendship like i shared a few episodes ago and you know dating and then obviously you'll know we're married and we've been married for almost 10 years so we did get married but neither of us had ever had sex before and you know going into that night i will say like there is you know you have that understanding biblically but you're like i've never experienced this i would say that really helped each of us is just. Preparing by reading really like christ centered teachings on sex and you know i don't recommend like you get to nitty gritty like way before you're married but just like you know we had had a good understanding but then as i got closer to the wedding day just really reading some things that people would recommended like good resources for learning about sex specifically remember any of those resources are you well the one that i thought was really helpful is called intended for pleasure which is very commonly known but i don't recommend it if you're not in a season of like engagement close to your wedding day like it might not be helpful you know just from attemptation standpoint because it's pretty nitty-gritty but like books like that i'm trying to think of some others it's okay so pleasure i know that that's a great one y'all started reading it and then you even brought it on your honeymoon and helpful well separately yeah we were meeting it together like right before we got married. Yeah and you know it's like you don't know what you don't know and i will say back then i was a little bit like embarrassed to just straight up asked people if the person that i know i was kind of like i don't really know what to ask and so i just kind of like okay i'm going to find some biblical resources and books that like our premiered counselors had recommended this was actually one of them and so i think preparing by learning a christ-centered view of sex because like bethany start earlier the whole mindset of serving if you go into your marriage with that perspective into the wedding night like how can i serve this other person and not just make it all about me me me me me me me me then it's less about like oh i can have a good experience i'm going to be awkward or is he going to like me it's like okay yeah those might be questions you might not know for sure the answer but like lord help me to make this about just like serving and loving and enjoying this gift and if it is awkward that's okay like if it's a little awkward we've never done this like we're not experienced pros here and we both know that and so was i and i you know we knew that going into it we're like this is the first time for both of us so yeah there might be like a little bit of awkwardness some clunkiness we're not prose we have no idea what we're doing we've never done this before i mean think about anything else in life right if you've never ever done it you've only learned about it but you've never done it like okay you're not going to be it's not going to be like the smoothest experience ever but if you have the right heart going into it i think that is what so beautiful and what so precious about the experience so first and me yeah we went into it like there were nerves there was like oh like anticipation but you know from the start even on our wedding night we had like a beautiful conversation just about how we wanted this first experience with each other to be about serving one another and like actually did the sweetest thing he was like i really want to model what christ was for the his disciples and for us you know the people when he came and so he had a little bowl of water and he washed my feet and it was like if anyone my sister knows that i really stinky feet is actually knew that too like i just have really stinky feet here but he washed my feet and he said i want this to be just a picture of how i want to serve you and love you in our relationship i want to love you like christ loved the church i want to be that in this marriage she's like i'm not going to be a perfectly i can't i'm not crying but i want to model that i want to have that heart of christ and so he's like i want to wash your feet to show you that it was just like oh like the sweetest thing and kind of set the tone for the rest of the evening and the romance and the passion and it was it was awesome. We have our whole lives to enjoy sexual intimacy like let's just enjoy this first night and then we're going to keep growing and learning and having fun together and just enjoying this gift and that's what it's been so 10 years later. Prepare you to make it not aw. How did you set yourself up for success i think like i am the queen of expectations and going into that you know you can kind of imagine like oh i hope it's like this or i hope it's just beautiful and all these things and so i think there were expectations but at the same time i just remember like telling myself like this is brand new like we've never done this because zach had been like such a man it was like you know i i think the best piece of advice was just don't have so many expectations don't try to picture what the perfect night would be totally enjoy whatever it is for what it is and if you look back and go oh wow that was kind of clunky or awkward a little bit like it's okay like love them don't make it about you have a selfless heart love them and don't have expectations and just whatever it is it is and there's things that can i look back and we do laugh about our first night like oh that was like so sweet and so beautiful but that one thing was really funny and it's just like it's even sweet bonding it's like the first time you're entering into that celebration of that covenant. Physically and so it's so beautiful but i mean i think we can see the humor sometimes and somehow how things unfold so yeah try not to have expectations just say lord let this be a beautiful celebration let us both just celebrate this and oh communicate a lot like don't be shy about your communication and you could even say like hey like i'm feeling a little nervous right now and you can even just say that and that immediately relieves all the time because it's not about you trying to pretend like you know everything you can just say i've never done this and i'm a little nervous are you yeah me too like okay great here we go you know totally i like that okay so what about you you're more fresh few years not even two and a half years ago so it is fresh hot off the press and i i mean i had the privilege of getting married a little bit older so that gave me a lot more time to your mother mary books listen to podcasts have other friends who were married at the time i got married it's like so many friends were married with you one of the first ones like in our friend group and stuff to get married yeah he didn't have quite the resources. So i would say like. Quick overview dave and i i am now 32 he and i'm 5 and 1/2 years older than him so i was 30 when i got married and he was 24 which sounds like a lot for 5 and a half years i love how you laugh and whatever i say it's like 24 and 30 seconds so we obviously had been friends and we started dating and then we got engaged and we were so excited to get married we were engaged for about six months and. A friend described it to me this way like preparing for intimacy preparing for that honeymoon she kind of described like okay when you're engaged you don't just go from not talking about it not thinking about it to okay now you're on your honeymoon full speed ahead she was like it's a little bit more like a ramp so you start as the day approaches you get more i guess specific with your conversations with counseling or maybe even some questions you might talk about together things you might discuss as you get closer to the wedding you start kind of like ramping up into that moment as far as like even internally like mentally you might be like okay how am i you know how am i feeling about this how am i thinking about this and you start preparing emotionally like you might even you know as you're preparing and maybe buying some fun things that you might wear on the honeymoon maybe even pulling them out or trying them on and saying okay like wow look god gave me a beautiful body to love my husband and you start just a mentally getting yourself in that place because if you if you're just going from 0 to 100 as far as like even allowing yourself to think about god's design for it it might be a bit of a shock so i think that for me that was actually extremely helpful in it i was very careful to have great mentors and we were in premarital counseling and we were very careful about our conversations guided by the advice we were getting so we were not just doing this on our own so i recommend you know finding a great older couple who you feel comfortable asking like really for you they might feel like uncomfortable questions everything from me even like you're like hey. You know some more medical stuff to just even practical like you've got to find a couple that you can talk to you about the nitty gritty and then dave and i both found i found a great girl who was married and then he found a guy that was married and we both had those individual people as our resource like our person that we could go to to talk about like. All the things you know like any question you have in your mind it's like i had a great. Godly woman who i said i really admire you and i totally trust you and she was super not awkward about everything and so we had so many conversations and she even made herself available like hey if you go on your honeymoon and you need someone to talk to you like you just need like hey we ran into this problem or i don't understand what's going on or this is overwhelming like she was available for me if we needed to talk and this guy was available for my husband if he needed to talk so they were married. Up for success was just the positive perspective that this godly woman shared with me and the same with our like this older couple who was counseling dave and i together in premier league counseling but what i found is that. There are a lot of people especially for women who talk about sex in a very negative way even when you're preparing for your honeymoon like it's going to be so awkward or you know like he's just going to want it so much more than you or whatever it is not realizing like wow our thoughts directly fuel our emotions and if i go into my honeymoon thinking like oh this is going to be so weird or this is going to be the worst or what are we gonna do like i feel really uncomfortable so instead i started developing a really positive beautiful christ centered about sex and about intimacy and even just the gift of being able to share my body with my husband and love him in that way even things like lingerie you know like instead of being like oh but you know i i have cellulite you know like now this is i can love my husband and i got me this body that i can love him with and he gets to love me with his body and so instead developing such a servant hearted mindset i'm telling you that. Preparation mentally helps me so much as i approached the honeymoon and now since i got married like two and a half years ago i've actually talked a lot about this over on my instagram. At bethany bill and one of the questions i got like and i still get all the time is this question is it awkward to be a virgin on your wedding night and people will always ask like oh so how was the first night how was it going and how did it go and something that i want to encourage you with is that one it's really nobody else's business like. Your honeymoon process in germany and those early days and weeks and months of marriage and there is no rule that says you have to fully like have sex the first night of your of your honeymoon and there's like this big expectation if you want to great and something that i intentionally decided i would never share about is did we have sex the first night did we not maybe it was two nights later maybe not i'm not ever going to share that because i think that it's so important to go into your honeymoon with this mindset of hey this is brand new we get to love each other and you know say it takes a couple days as we like really get comfortable and you're doing all the wonderful gifts that maybe you've never enjoyed before and you slowly ease into it that's totally fine you know like you and your husband can you communicate and if you both have open hands and say we're just trying to love each other and if we ease into this a little bit slowly that's okay because we're just trying to love each other well and maybe i feel ready but you you feel like nervous so let's just take out a little bit slower and if you both have that servant heart. Heartedness toward each other and makes it so like all the pressure just kind of disappears and i think you may even feel like more excited than you than you realize so i would say for our like. First time i would say that it's exactly like you described kristen it's so there's so much anticipation there's so many nerves but think about it whenever you do something super like exciting that's brand new think about if you're going to go to like disney world for the first time you're excited or you're going to maybe you're going to go and you're going to see like your favorite athlete or a singer think about how excited and how much you anticipate it and you have those nerves or maybe you want to meet someone really amazing you feel nervous and excited it's kind of those same sort of jitters where you're like but does that mean it's awkward no i think that. In being with the person who has stood before you and said i am with you till death do you part i love you through the good the bad the poor and the healthy. That is the most comfortable place that you would ever want to share that first intimate moment with i mean when you hear it all these songs on the radio and these country songs like hey you know take me back to the first time it's like so you're telling me that it's more comfortable to do the first time with someone who has no commitment to you who has no care for you or who has no long-term. I don't think it is i think it's the most comfortable place to fully reveal and enjoy this moment with would be with the person who has said. I love you and i am here for you no matter what so for me i know i'm going a long time almost done period i would say that. So let's see i would definitely recommend dear young married couple they have an instagram it's just a handle at dear young married couple they also have a website dear young married couple.com they are specifically a ministry for young married couples and they answer all sorts of questions they bring amazing people on to discuss all of these sorts of things like okay your honeymoon just a lot of questions that we might feel uncomfortable asking like about sex or intimacy so i think this would be a great resource even if you're you know not even in a relationship they have a lot of stuff that's very appropriate for singles as well and then you can just kind of choose like okay is that something for dating or even engagement but i would highly recommend if you are engaged for you and your fiance to both definitely dig into their resources and. Let's see obviously sex period in the longings of a girl's heart i actually wrote that while i was dating and then engaged and i'm telling you that doing a deep dive on god's design for sex by writing that book was one of the best preparations for a marriage that i could have ever been given i had no idea how much of a blessing reading and researching on god's design for sex was going to benefit my own marriage so just as a first-hand experience like don't neglect really learning and growing in your understanding of god's. Good biblical design for sex because you will be so much more prepared for it then you know you would if you didn't and then there is one other or two other books there's a book called intimate issues by linda dillow and lorraine prentice and then the other one is. And these would be really good questions for our books for i definitely i think like engaged closer to getting married or married the other one is 25 questions you're afraid to ask about love sex and intimacy by dr julie slattery and that would be a great one to get like as you're engaged maybe take it on your honeymoon that sort of thing and i know you were going to recommend that just a podcast a lot of you have heard us talk about dr julie you just mentioned her about her podcast java with julie and then her ministry authentic intimacy we have learned so much from dr slattery on just all things biblical sexuality and it's a ministry geared toward women which is unique and that so many ministries are for men and women for marriage is you know lots for men but not a lot of ministries about sexuality for women specifically and so they have so many amazing blog posts like an incredible archive you can search so many podcasts answering specific questions things that you may be walking through because you're your situation is unique in some way or not addressing it here you can go okay how you know what how should i think about this but look and so please check out these resources on we personally have grown so much and i think there's a lot of fear in the unknown absolutely and you know if you're having sex for the first time on your honeymoon there's so many unknowns but you can prepare emotionally and spiritually mentally by understanding more about god's design on a spiritual level of just like even a medical level like you're saying practically biologically look okay god created men and women and there's things you can learn that will take some of the mystery of like oh which is why you're feeling because you just don't understand something and as you understand them and you see oh i see why god was so intentional on this way he made my body that way oh this is normal like oh okay and it takes some of the fear away so that's really important i also want to say and then i have two things for free i know that. You listening right now you have your own story we each have our own story and i know your story might be yes i am approaching my wedding day and you know my husband has had sex before but i never have liked is that going to be awkward because he's had experience yes he regrets it you know i was actually a friend of mine that i was talking to she had that same situation her husband had sex years passed in a relationship he greatly regretted it he's walking with the lord committed to this covenant marriage he was about to enter into and she's like i just feel awkward like he has experience and i'm this newbie but they both you know and they had all the reconciliation from his past relationship with each other you know they were really desiring to honor god in their relationship in their marriage and that goes back to the point of our god is in the business of redemption it doesn't mean that sometimes we don't still experience consequences but god can redeem any relationship and so they entered into their honeymoon their first night it was first time for her to have sex he had it before but they said afterwards like it was so beautiful to watch god's redeeming work to bring beauty about their covenant or you both might you might be like i've had sex so is he we've had multiple partners like. Is there any beauty left for us at our future like yes there is because purity sexual purity it's not a destination you don't just arrived one day like yes i've stayed pure my whole life and i'm sure it's like no it's a daily choice and sometimes those choices little choices like a bigger choices that go off of god's path we sinned against god sexually and and we repent of that we come before the lord and say lord help me to walk a path that honors you tomorrow is a new day your mercies are new every morning lord help me and every day is a day that we can choose to follow god by his strength by his grace to walk in a way that honors him in our sexuality and so i want you to hear that there is redemption for you period sexual purity is not something you land at it's not like make it to the wedding night and i've done it it's not like you're conquering something it's lord help me every day to walk this and so you can decide today lord i want to walk a different path i want to walk a path on you i want to grow in this i want to become discipled sexually through these incredible resources that can help me grow and understand your word better and got him that and he can bring about a beautiful marriage in your future. I like that. Backtrack. Tell me a little bit more okay so back to the things that were helpful one other thing and then i have one other thing and then you're talking about in preparing to go into your first night. We're engaged dave and i are engaged and we're preparing for our honeymoon marriage all of the things okay so back to like. What's the first night awkward and this is just like a little tip to help you prepare to make it not awkward and actually you know the friend who was giving me lots of great advice that was married this is one of the things she recommended and so as we were closer to our. You know i'm getting married dave and i basically had decided we were going to have a conversation and share anything that we felt super insecure about it on our bodies or about us that would maybe be a hindrance when we were on our honeymoon and so like for me i felt like okay does he even know what cellulite is and i thought i've got it. I want to rumpole and i'm like have you ever heard of the words yeah i think so we can even really know. He could be extra careful and affirming and gentle because he knew that was like a sensitive place and then he was able to share some things and i'm telling you like and i won't you know i won't share exactly what we both share but for each one of us it might be different and we may say like i'm really insecure really like nervous about this or like i really feel like this part of me is just ugly or whatever then when you go into the honeymoon the level of sensitivity and love and affirmation you can give to one another just like i said that servant's heart you're able to serve each other so well because you even you know you love each other so much and if you're careful with those sensitive places of your now you know husband or your wife's heart him to you and you to him he can just make it for such a beautiful time and i think that we is. Women sometimes can feel like i'm not going to share that or i'm just going to keep it in and then it can one little thing can like ruin so much about our you know intimacy because we're letting something as silly as like cellulite get in the way of really enjoying you know maybe you're trying to hide your rear so he can't see it but it's like you know just communicating about those things because there is no woman in the world who has whatever even a perfect body is. Has a perfect body so sometimes just communicating can be so helpful and then the last thing. The last thing i would say is that. Really really really really really really view that beginning year even the first few years as a journey don't view it as like okay well we are failures or we just our bodies are broken because we don't you know whatever that arrival experience it is whatever that is in your mind like we're not there and oh no like this isn't feel the way that i thought it should feel i am telling you that it is such a journey and you know i know there are so much stuff there's so much stuff that can happen in even that first year that oftentimes kind of resolves itself like this is a little tmi but it's something that so many young. Newlyweds deal with like i got a really bad uti a few months after being married and i got it treated with antibiotics but the antibiotics didn't really work and then i got a horrible kidney infection and then they didn't diagnose it right and i was literally for days in bed like just literally i thought i was going to die and and for those who are horrible might not know uti stands for urinary tract infection right yeah and it's something that's common they will often call it like honeymooners it's very common but it was so just as a result of being a newlywed and i was like wow i'm like two months married and now i'm on my deathbed you know and it's like what in the world and so things like that where it's like wow you're learning your body is literally adjusting so just have a lot of patience and like kristen said with expectations just really know that it's a journey you know kristen have been married for 10 years i'm sure by the time and i have been married for 10 years are intimacy will have grown so much just because our relationship is deeper we know each other better we know how to love one another better we understand better how our bodies work we understand better how to serve the other so that's my final word of just you just it caution is to just be patient don't put a huge expectation that you have to reach some point or else you're a failure. Have patience with yourself have patience with your spouse and just you know give it time and i think if your intentional and if you're seeking to grow and you're seeking advice every year that goes by you're going to look back and go wow our love is just that much deeper so. Take a deep breath and it's not going to be okay that's all i have now i have two more things one of them is kind of like a funny thing actually gave me some advice about this is so random but it was so helpful and it was like a medical piece of advice they said actually if you use the bathroom very quickly after intercourse that can actually kind of like help flush things out and help prevent utis so i did that sorry. Little kids like their private parts like all these hilarious like nicknames yeah and it's almost like like god has work like there are words for a reason and someone just said you know early on like really grow in your understanding of terminology it's great because it will help give you vocabulary for how to talk about things if everything's just kind of like a nickname and a crude word it's like it kind of takes the respect out of it and it doesn't give you the book the vocabulary to know how to express if there's something wrong or if you're feeling something within your body you're like i don't even know what this is because i've never really learned about this and i don't even know what to call this or you know if you're trying to communicate something that you appreciate or you don't really find a joyful in the marriage if you don't have the language for it it can create a lot of awkwardness and it can also prevent you from sharing and talking openly and then it just becomes worse and worse as time goes on and less and less enjoyable because there isn't that open communication you're even better because you're like wow they don't care about me so would you say intended for yeah sure would be about that is intended for pleasure it's much more medical yeah so it's not going to like it actually does give you like okay biblical foundations for things but some of the other resources you like that earlier which let's link those all below so you can find those but yeah antenna for pleasure is one i would recommend taking on your honeymoon because it does it gives you a little bit more of the medical vocabulary the biology to express what you're thinking feeling or what you have questions about in proper terms and i think it just brings a level of honor yeah the whole experience respect is got intended and then it just gives you a lot more confidence as you're communicating with your spouse moving forward in your marriage and that book antenna for pleasure all so acts as a really great index like a resource to just go okay i'm having this like issue but i don't even know how to get help for this and that can i encountered some of that on our honeymoon and we just looked up in the book like oh this problem and i was like oh wow like so many other people have encountered this world not the first yes and there was amazing like medical advice spiritual advice for that and it helped us so much even on our honeymoon so yeah just another tip it and i know we could go on and on and on and i know but we will wrap this up yes we do want to hear from you though on this regardless of your season come hang out with us over on instagram we also want to give you a freebie for those of you who are in the trenches of fighting for.
