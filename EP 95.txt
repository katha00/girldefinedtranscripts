Okay so who if i had to ask you this question and i'm going to ask you right now whatever you're doing washing dishes going on a run maybe you're just sitting around driving or in your house whatever you're doing. Who would you say what would you say is defining your womanhood. When you think about your life as a woman and you think about what am i striving after what do i feel like i can't live without what do i feel like if i don't get that next season or if i don't get that next thing that job promotion if i don't recover from this illness. What do you feel like you are upholding and saying this is my goal as a woman this is what i'm going after. What do you view as successful what which women are you looking at and thinking like that is a woman that i want to be like and even subtly maybe influences on social media people in your workplace keep your friends and you're thinking of i could just be more like her. What is it about her that you're looking at and saying. That is true womanhood i know for me from a young age i shared a little bit in the intro i started questioning i remember the first time wondering what it meant to be beautiful and i'm talking physically beautiful i was out shopping with my mom a lady came up to us i was around 10 years old and she started going on and on about how you know i had great modeling material and she was passing my mom her card and said i want your daughter to come work for our agency we raise top models from a young age and i remember that was the first time i really asked the question of myself. Am i beautiful. What is it even mean to be beautiful and i started looking around at other girls who were also getting affirmed as being physically beautiful but they looked really different than me so i wondered what if she's beautiful and she has this curly dark hair and i have this really stringy thin blonde hair like what is true beauty and that's a question i know every single one of us as women whether it's a really young age whether we're a little bit older i know bethany and i joke she's like. And it's just like. Becoming i was idolizing it at a young age without realizing obsessing over it i remember i would brush my hair into the tightest tightest ponytail you can imagine the tightest ponytail and then i would grab that ponytail to squeeze it even tighter and then i would douse my entire head with hairspray because in my view a beautiful look at that time in my life meant the tightest ponytail without a single fly away hair so i would doubt it in hairspray to secure every single straight hair. But the point is that i was obsessed with wanting to be beautiful but not understanding a biblical perspective of what that was okay so i'm searching for work i'm searching for identity i'm searching for value i'm searching for my identity as a young girl and you know i'm i was raised in a wonderful christian home we both were with christian with parents who are christians who love us who care about us who want to teach us the bible but still i are flesh is searching right and the world is influencing us influencing us and even as we so often can be raised in a christian environment we are battling with this question of who am i what gives me worth what gives me value and i took that into my high school years i remember searching for identity in sports searching for it and being popular wanting to be accepted by certain people because i thought okay that will give me more than value and then that led me to like i shared a little bit earlier to a modeling agency that claimed to be family family friendly and they said hey we want you to work for us and i started exploring this opportunity you know i knew that there could be a lot of pitfalls for christians with specific values in that industry but i thought okay they claim to be family friendly i'm going to try to give this a go and for one year i worked as a model i was under this contract and i remember it was during that one year that i discovered that you know like i think we think is women. If i could just be beautiful if i could just look like that other woman and it's like this carrot that the enemy dangles in front of us saying if only you look like her you know if only you look like the the world's number one most beautiful women that people features every year like what the heck what is that even mean there's so many different varieties god made but we think if i could just reach that plateau of being that sort of beautiful then i'll be totally happy i'll be totally content and i'm telling you that one year of working as a model having that title which i thought would bring so much confidence would bring so much security. I was more self-absorbed with my outward appearance trying to please people and i became less and less happy my joy was being zapped i was not living my life in a way to glorify god in that season i was just trying to receive the acceptance and approval of others chasing after the wrong identity buying into a lie and so it was through that experience that god really helped me see. Wow it doesn't matter what you achieve even if you get the title of a model it's not enough because that is the lie of the enemy god designed us to find our full identity in him and our full confidence in him and living out for his glory and so that took me on a journey of eventually bethany and i starting girl to find will get more to that later but i know from a young age i was buying into so many lives totally and if you want a deep dive again into this topic. Grab a copy of our book girl defined god's radical design for beauty femininity and identity i promise you that this book will not disappoint i actually got a message today from a girl and she was telling you a woman actually she's already read the book once and she restarted it in january as a way to just like refresh and refocus and i'm like that's a great idea so if you are like man i wish there was a community i wish there was like people i could do this with be the leader grab a copy of this book it doesn't matter how old you are you know be a leader and and take initiative invite friends whether it's virtually saying hey let's read through girl to find together let's discuss it comes with discussion questions i just want to encourage you to take those steps don't just listen and then move on with your life take practical steps that will help you get towards better living out and embracing god's design for your womanhood. Some of you may relate to kristen you may be like oh yeah that's totally me or you might be a little bit more tomboyish or just grew up a little bit more like me where you're like wow i didn't think about that for a long time so me you know struggling with finding my identity i feel like i was a late bloomer i didn't really think about a lot of stuff i was just a kid i was happy playing but their did come a point where you know i was definitely older than 10 where i did start to notice the girls around me and i started to think hmm. But you know who are the popular girls who are the you know pretty girls who are the ones that are getting attention who are the ones that you know other people want to be around and i noticed this one girl and if she was very popular and she had breasts in her hair and this was a girl at church and so i thought. If people really like her and she's really popular and she wears these really cute rats maybe if i wear barrettes in my hair then i'll be really popular and cool as well and so i thought maybe that's the way i can be you know. That's basically what i was doing so i went to the store with my mom and i convinced her to buy me a pack of brats and i thought you know what if she wears one beret on each side of her head imagine imagine the statement and how cool i'll be if i line each side of my head with breaths and i am not joking i literally took all of the barrettes off the package and put half on one side of my head and half on the other and i remember going to church. So cool so amazing but of course that high only lasted for so long i had to find another thing and so that is one of the first times that i remember really searching for my identity and approval in the eyes of others and as we're talking i really want you to think for your own life you know was it a beret the situation was it someone telling you were you were pretty was it trying to earn the approval of a parent maybe through a sporting activity think in your own life that first time that you try to find your worth and identity and saying who am i who am i as a woman who gives me my worth i know for me moving into high school sports really became. Play really well and people think i'm amazing and so i was so motivated to win and to be the best on my team and it worked for a long time because i was really good at sports but you know every now and then you have a bad game and then the eyes aren't on you the accolades aren't in your direction it's on whoever is on the team who pulled through that game and i remember thinking in those moments like so discouraged so down because who am i not bethany the basketball girl if i'm not the best on the team if i'm not the most athletic the you know mvp every time who am i and i would get so down and so discouraged beyond just like okay i need to do better come on let's go it was just like you know to a very unhealthy you know not a good place and then from there moving out of high school i had these dreams eventually of getting married or you know at least having a boyfriend moving in that direction and i remember thinking like okay i'm past high school i'm done with basketball okay maybe if i can just you know get a boyfriend maybe work towards getting married then i will be satisfied i'll be complete and that will just be the start of my life it'll be beautiful i'll go on to have so many kids it'll just be amazing and so i started to develop this dream and as the years went on you're one. You're too i'm starting to hit my mid-twenties eventually starting to push my late twenties and literally. I have no ring on that finger i was having like a. I was having a crisis because. I was you know shooting for this thing that i thought would bring me complete happiness and would make me a woman and would make me a valuable and i had to really come to this place of like reckoning with god like okay what gives me worth what gives me value. What am i living for and that was one of the points where i had to really come you know come face-to-face with this question of who defines my womanhood and what am i living for maybe you have already been to that place and you're like wow i'm on a great tracker maybe you're like yeah you know i thought i was but now i'm facing something new maybe you're like kristen and i knew moms and you're like it's a whole new battleground wherever you are in life this is something i think we can never quit on we have to constantly go back to god's word go back to scripture to figure out what actually gives us worth what actually gives us value and who were actually living for yeah and it's so important because as we find our true identity in christ that is where true peace joy and purpose is found and so if you find yourself wrestling and you have a lot of anxiety things are really keeping you up at night because you feel like you're not where you should be as we ground everything about who we are and our purpose and our season of life. In the truth of god's word for us as women. It is so liberating and the best biblical sense of that word and every single one of us we have to come to a point where we truly and genuinely ask the question and i don't think this is a one-time thing i think i used to think this was a one-time thing but i think this question is something every year every new season every new struggle we ask and it's this who as christian women who are we going to listen to when it comes to our identity as women are we going to listen to what the world has to say about our identity. Or are we going to listen to god and i would even add another one on are we going to listen to our hearts because our hearts are often. Singer and the little one he barely sings so the older one he's singing with me and i'm like this is the worst singing between the two of us like it's the i don't know what the opposite of harmony is but it's like the opposite of whatever and i'm like and then we have to sing multiple verses and i'm like no one can see no one is running except y'all have a camera that room like christmas. We weren't but i wish we had been i would have recorded that so fast okay so all that to say that our hearts are prone to wander and culture is feeding us an opposite message but in so many ways like adam and eve in the garden right the enemy will say well did god really say and lies can look appealing they can look beautiful they can seem truth filled but they're not and that our hearts are telling us all sorts of things are emotions are often leading us rather than us leading our emotions but the truth of god's word and so we have to stop and ask. Where you know who am i going to listen to my heart society or god and if we say yes i want to listen to god then we have to go to his word we have to discover what he's saying because if we don't know his truth how in the world can we possibly live by his truth. One of the things we talked about in our book girl to find early on i think it's maybe chapter one or two is this identity of i mean this identity is this idea of an identity checklist and we call it the big bad ident. List of all of the things that we need to have the boxes checked on in order to be a successful woman in order to find our true identity right. Now hear me out from the youngest to the oldest here's some examples of what our identity are personal identity checklist might look like so maybe you're younger you're on tik tok instagram and you're thinking oh i'm supposed to dance like all those girls if i don't have followers and tik tok videos like all those popular girls. I'm supposed to make the varsity team as a 9th grader if you're in high school i know sports are a huge deal for sports players you think oh i have to do that or i'm ruined okay got it check. I don't do that i don't want what i got oh my goodness on social media it's like. The nicest most innocent moms but then it's like a trend and then all the sudden it's like boom baby let me show you what i got you know so it's like i feel like we have to think in terms of like our modern day like let's not put ourselves above this you know like a lot of us okay we might not do this in real life but a lot of us do it on. I'm supposed to get married young old never i mean the messages are so conflicting right like every every chick flick is all about finding your dream like match and sailing off into the sunset but then at the same time cultures voice is like you don't need a man you're strong as above live your life alone like oh okay that sounds great like okay so where are what checklist do you have when it comes to relationships on either end of the spectrum maybe you're thinking oh i need to be a boss baby like i need to i need to tell people what i want and get my way no one's going to stop on me maybe you have been hurt legitimate you've been sitting against and very hurtful ways and not his jaded you and not now you find yourself to be a very hard woman and you think okay i've got to stand up for myself i've got to do what i need to do no one's gonna ever meet me over again okay got it check for you that is what it means to be a woman maybe you push everyone aside you're like my dreams come first before family before god before anything maybe you're not saying that but you look at your calendar you look at your life you look at your goals what you're pursuing relentlessly and you start to realize oh okay got it check for me it's pursuing my dreams or less sleep maybe it's has to do with beauty like for me or sports like for bethany we mentioned earlier so many things goals i mean the list goes on and on our identity checklist is endless and did you notice that a lot of those things weren't necessarily bad things some of them were so great but some of them it's like okay like not necessarily bad but when we view that as a checklist for what it means to be a true the local woman that becomes our focus that becomes our aim and that is really when it comes alive and i find it even more confusing because on the one hand we're being told that true satisfaction is found in loving yourself and being true to yourself i mean that is being like oh yeah like nobody's business right now i mean. Just be true to yourself love yourself you know speak your truth. We're also being told like here's what it takes to be lovable and this is what it takes to be a real woman know it's super confusing so here's what i mean it's like you just need to be true to yourself embrace your true beauty but then all the sudden we're also you know seeing like a rise and cosmetic procedures and basically you know breast implants and lip lip lip enhancement flip fillers you can kind of like redo your eyebrows in this way change your eye shape you know get your nose kind of shaved down so that it can be a different shape and. You should look a little bit different if your nose were just a little bit slimmer if your lips are still a little bit bigger i mean the amount of procedures that you can get done from you know breast enhancements but enhancements i mean these are things that. I feel like you used to be a used to be like oh only the most rich and powerful and famous did these things but now it's average everyday people it's becoming more affordable it's becoming more available and so it's becoming an option like. Liked and valuable you know the magazines we you know literally we have a magazine that is put out that says the top 100 most beautiful women and then there is. Most beautiful woman top 100 and then we have the number one most beautiful woman in every year it changes but somehow for that year above every other woman above every other hair color skin color this one particular look with this one particular eye shape body type everything they're saying this is what it means to be the most beautiful woman and so all of us that's like great well i guess we're just over here you know but the next year maybe there's hope because it looks like me i mean it's just absolutely ridiculous because it's like speak your truth be true to yourself the standard you know it's like how can we ever measure up how can we ever live by this i mean it's just insane they're so like the bachelor bachelorette shows that just i think corrupt our mind warp our perspective of what true worth lasting worth identity in christ all of that you know where it's found and. I you know i am not standing up here going look at you how dare you it's like i have my own amount of sin and wrong perspective to work on it and i am constantly striving to grow and you don't be sanctified sanctification is a process so we're not standing here like pointing our fingers saying how dare you if you watch that show but we really do want you to take into account like who am i following who am i listening to am i constantly following shows or you know social media influencers who are pouring these perspectives and slowly chipping away what i think and what i value you know is my is my fashion to find by what i see out there and i feel like i have to spend and spend to keep up with the latest i just want you to stop and say okay. What does god say about all of this. What is his word say am i aligning my values with his truth or am i looking and absorbing and taking in what other people say is the measure of success and then striving endlessly and i just want to encourage you to know that god's measure of success. Measure of success it is completely different and we know. From scripture over and over again that are worth has nothing to do with our accomplishments but everything to do with the worst that god. Places on us your worst sister has nothing to do with your achievements how pretty other people think you are your successes and ultimately has to do with the gospel in jesus coming to earth to die for you so that you could be adopted into his family and be a child a daughter of god ultimately that is the most important thing about you and we know in scripture we see things like tomorrow is deceitful and beauty sleeping but a woman who fears the lord she is to be praised and that man looks at the outward appearance but god looks at the heart we know that god's measure of success and his standard for living is just completely different because ultimately it's found in christ and ultimately are found in him and he says stop living stop striving after what other people are doing live by my standard focus on the inner person of the heart run the race i've set before you and that's the race of living for my glory and telling others about me and so i just want to encourage you as your thinking about all these things and maybe feeling convicted and struggling with all of this just to know that there is a different way there is a more freeing way you can lay down all of this bondage and the weight of striving to measure up and say no i'm not gonna believe those life anymore i'm going to instead chase after truth and just remember god doesn't base your worth on any of those things he doesn't base your worth on how pretty you are. Amongst your peers. It seems like everyone on social media is like i just thought you said here's my renovation and you know like millions of dollars later yes. We have to get out of this religious workspace way of living or culture they do that too here's what you need to do to have value and ask questions oftentimes we do that too god hears what i can do to be valuable in your eyes we need to get rid of all of that and embrace the truth of god's word which is found in his word but then also in the gospel and knowing we are redeemed to our god and that is the most important thing about us and i love what you said about like when we remember what christ did for us the gospel when we keep that at the forefront of our mind that christ came to this earth died a crew some death so sinners like us could turn to him and have an opportunity to have our sins forgiven by the perfect savior and when we place our trust and faith in him he adopts us into his family and when that transaction happens really we become a new creature in christ a new creature in christ and he wipes away all of our sins he gives us that eternal life and the most incredible thing that happens is that he gives us a brand new purpose so our identity as christians it's easy to throw the word around and to kind of forget what it actually means because when we are adopted and i'm telling you after adopting our two boys from ukraine and walking through that earthly adoption process i feel like it opened up my eyes and gave me the most beautiful picture of why scripture uses that parallel illustration of earthly adoption versus our adoption as children of god because it is the most compelling powerful thing when we brought the boys into our home they took on a new identity they took on a new culture they had a new purpose and meaning and value they were loved they were accepted they took on a new name they now have a new inheritance and seeing that physically just helped me to see in a much much deeper way what the bible is talking about when it says that's what god does for us we are lost orphaned daughters and god brings us in. He accepts as he dies for us he becomes our father we become his daughters he gives us a new name and you inheritance a new identity and a new purpose and when we believe that and remember that and say oh that is who i am it changes everything about what we value literally understanding our identity completely changes what we view as our purpose because when you keep your identity as an adopted daughter of god here on this earth to glorify god to build his kingdom then when you're tempted to think beauty is what's going to really give you worth on purpose you're tempted to think that next job is what's going to finally satisfy your tempted to think that your season of life is where your true identity is found you can immediately dismiss those lies and say that is not my true purpose that is not my truest identity i am a daughter of god and i am here for god's glory to glorify him in every season of stage every stage of life and i am here to build his kingdom and i can do that right now my life is an oh i'm open-handed surrendered to god and my life is about glorifying and serving him and how liberating and freeing is that and i love that you share your whole adoption story and you know. All about finding your identity in christ and learning to trust him and are brand new book not part of the plan. Can bring up a lot of just like feelings of anxiety and just. What will the future look like if i surrender what will the future look like and kristen and i open up our lives in the most raw and relatable way and are brand new book not part of the plan trusting god with the twists and turns of your story if you are a woman who says yes i want to trust god with my you know just identity i want to trust him with my future i want to give up and surrender these plants i've had my hands you know clenched around i encourage you to grab a copy of not part of the plan trusting god with the twists and turns of your story you can grab that girl defined calm slash trust. Learning to trust god and again you can invite friends to do this there's a complete study guide that goes along with it it comes it's free with the book so grab a copy and i know that will be super helpful as you learn to trust god in this area and as we are wrestling with our identity and the cultures goal posts are constantly changing like you were saying about beauty and all of these different areas. One thing that we can count on when we when we find our identity in christ we can count on the fact that his goal posts for truth it never changes it never changes and so why do we as a mere humans write god knows we are but that's like he knows where weak that's why his word exhorts us in this but we're so prone to wander and chase after things that are so temporal that aren't going to last that are going to change when god is saying come to me like i am the living water comes to me and find your identity and your purpose in me i have a beautiful identity for you as my daughter and when you find it in me you will be anchored you will not be wavering so much of the anxiety you fear is because you're looking for your purpose and identity in the wrong places but when you find it in me. How many of us long for security right we long for stability we long for peace we long for inner peace and the deepest places of our heart that no one else can see where we know there's a lot of anxiety god is saying when you come to me and you find your identity in me and what i did for you and your purpose as a christian woman. You will be so secure you will be so confident in me there will be no goal posts that are changing my definition of womanhood of your identity of success it's always the same and your purpose will remain the same from the time you're young until the time you die and here's the truth that god wants us to remember from his word that he is our creator which means he is the only one who has the true authority to say where are worth and value comes from. I mean let that sink in the world has a lot of things to say our hearts have a lot of things to say but who created us. Who made us who is giving us the very breath in our lungs who decided the day we were going to be born who knows the days that we have to live on this earth who knows the amount of hair that we have on our head and my hair is very thin so the lord knows i don't have as many hairs as many of you but i'm secure and not this is how the lord made me i'm accepting it. God is the one who knows all things he plays the stars and the heaven the moon he created the galaxies that same god is your creator and therefore he is the only one who has the authority to say what gives you purpose and value and where you're worth comes from so sister let's turn to him let's turn to that creator and let's remember choose from his word i just want to read you a quick list if you're like still wrestling with believing this i want to read you some truths about what god's word says about us as believing women who are adopted into god's family god says that we are loved by him. We are redeemed by him we are forgiven by him. We're adopted by him. Your daughters of him. We're intricately made by him. We're made for his glory were made to be in an intimate relationship with him. We are sealed by the holy spirit. We are filled with hope in christ and our purpose and all of this is to live a life to glorify god to point others to him and to build his kingdom i want you to imagine what your life would look like right now if you stopped trying to measure up to the ever-changing standards of society and instead started listening to who god says you are as his redeemed daughter all of those things you just read kristen and there are so many more i mean if we look in scripture it's like these are unchanging you know these are not things that are going to move tomorrow and god's gonna say oh i just here's what i say now like know his word is unchanging and so i just want you to think like wow. What would your life look like if you stopped chasing in this never-ending a hamster wheel where it's like never ends trying to measure up to society and instead said god i'm going to choose to be a woman who embraces your word i'm going to be choose to be a woman who lives out my identity and you and who says wow. Living for you knowing you pointing others to you truly is the most purpose. Most wonderful most satisfying thing i could ever do with my life like imagine how different your life goals would look if you really believe that. Imagine how different your relationships would look. It's really you weren't the most important thing in your life but jesus were imagine imagine how much more seriously you take god's word if you truly believe that it was the most important truth in the world. Imagine how much more seriously you take your relationship with god. Imagine how different your perspective of yourself would be when you looked in the. If you saw yourself through god's eyes just imagine how differently. He feels bad that i have a hurting pimple on my nose he's not like you today you know it's like know he loves me just the same and that's. Who god says you are and what your purpose in life is truly imagine how differently your thoughts would be when you passed a billboard with a perfectly airbrushed and photoshop to model on it instead of thinking like i'm worthless imagine. What you would think is that like that doesn't define my word god doesn't measure the successful woman and the worth of a woman you know she's on a billboard with you know photoshop the legs that are half the size of things i never will be you know like that's not it imagine how much your womanhood would be about bringing honor and glory to god rather than yourself and that's the heart of everything we want to share with you today. It is ultimately about honoring bringing honor and glory to god rather than to yourself and i want to read you this quote from our book a girl define god's radical design for beauty femininity and identity and like i said you can grab that girl to find.com or wherever books are sold and if we say. God is looking for women like you to courageously go against the grain of modern culture he needs women who are brave women who will set a new trend. Think outside the box and raise the bar for femininity. He needs women who refuse to live for the applause of this world and instead live for the applause of their king. And we want you to help us share this message with other women so that they can find freedom as well so please leave a five-star review leave a comment let us know what you like about this and go back through the archives and be encouraged listen on your walks listen as you're driving cuz we want you to know god deeper we want you to be a woman who truly embraces your identity as god's redeemed daughter thanks so much for spending time with us today and we hope that you'll join us again next week see you later guys.
