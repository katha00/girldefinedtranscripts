We have a special episode for our married women talking about something that isn't really talked about a lot in the church in fact i was just talking to a friend and we were talking about this topic of when you're married and you find yourself noticing other men or being attracted to certain personalities and other men like is that wrong is there a line you shouldn't cross we often hear topics of purity talked about for single women in the church but then what happens when you're married to verses on purity still apply to us how do we honor our husbands how do we appreciate our husbands and the unique gifts and qualities that god is giving them without letting our thoughts fantasize about other men and if you're in a place where you're like yeah i'm going there in my mind i'm fantasizing about other men i married i don't know what to do we are going to get into all of that today on the girl to find show what's up y'all it's bethany kristen and audrey here today and i was not working she'll probably be a little older you know she's getting a month she's so sweet i hope she stays. I have been actually thinking about this conversation about fantasy fantasizing and just you know creating even emotional relationships with other men what about when someone slides into your dms as a married woman what about when you are at the grocery store and you run into that neighbor that person from your church and they strike up a conversation with you and you're like this seems to be getting like maybe more emotional like what are we doing with this what if you walk into church and you're like notice that that guy's look really attractive but you're married maybe even have kids like what do we do with this and i you know i've heard secular sources talked about this and. Is really encouraged for single women and like unmarried women but then once you're married it's almost like the conversation goes silent like there's a lot of help and. What if i find myself attracted or getting emotionally attached or just admiring certain men maybe too much to where it's not even just a healthy like wow i admire them as a godly man i appreciate them but like my thoughts are going beyond that i'm starting to imagine like oh i wonder what it would be like to be married to them or to be in a relationship with them or how would my life be different or even just physical attraction noticing things like as we age oftentimes things are different than when we first got married so can even be a temptation to notice people who are more physically attractive or one of the areas that i feel like is the least talked about area is and this is going to feel like squirming in your bones but it's true like when it comes to actual sexual intimacy fantasizing about other men to be able to you know how to have a more pleasurable experience yes very very common in something that's just not really talked about right oh yeah so i'm just gonna say all the awkward things were going to know we have to because this is very real and this is something that is i think conversations we need to have and that as a married woman we need to be supporting each other yes in in one accountability because we i think any of you listening who are married with say i do value my marriage like i think the majority of us would say that we do want to honor our covenants we do want to stay emotionally physically one with our husband in all aspects but. It's the enemy is crafty and he is deceitful and he will get us when we least expect it and i think that it's wise for us to have these conversations and say you know what as christian sisters we need to be encouraging each other in this area reminding each other of truth holding each other accountable and praying for each other and just like even what do you do if. You find that other men they know you're married but maybe they are trying to strike up an emotional relationship with you like how do you even deal with that how do you respond should you talk to your husband about it are you too embarrassed you know just like all of that it's you know i don't know why i don't know why we feel talking about it but there's definitely. You know like i've always just been kind of on the hot always looking and so it's just hard because it doesn't just go away i mean i know for sure after i got married i found that i was like oh this is something i have to be really proactive about because i'm still like almost in that single yeah i don't know was that something you don't yes oh yeah for sure i remember right after i got married. We were living in an apartment right near one of the big the big grocery stores here in texas h-e-b shout out to oliver texas and i remember i was like freshly made within our first year and there was this like there are certain group of guys that worked there they were like the stockers or whatever and every time i would go i felt like they were always there for some reason and they were always like. Looking at me and like kind of making comments and like not whistling but like that kind of vibe and i remember just like. Feelings of okay before i was married i would be really flattered by this attention but how do i handle this now as a married woman like in a way that honors my husband that shows i am not interested but doesn't like take it to heart or allow it to start stirring things within me and so i remember that i would have to be really intentional when i would go into that grocery store knowing that this like a group of guys that they were almost always there and i would just have to like i would not i would purpose to not look at them like i contact i would just focus on my tasks and then afterwards if i was tempted to like think thoughts that word you know good i would just have to take my thoughts captive like no i'm not going there no i'm married you know got you for my husband and i would have to be really intentional but it did catch me off guard because that transition from single to marriage and not in a covenant to in a covenant there's a lot of change that has to take place emotionally i think for many of us as women and sometimes it can be hard yeah so i think this is the part that gets confusing because. God created beauty he created us as sexual beings he created attraction he created you know there's just that's how he made men and women and humans you know i mean we just a beautiful sunset we admire it and so it was just hard though where is that balance when you see someone where you're like oh they're an attractive person like is it a sin to be like oh my goodness that's an attractive person i just like you know my husband you know i think that's the thing i kind of want to talk about because we all know this attractive people and if we'd have to like live in a cave you know if not we all right we all come across people that are physically. They were talking all about like fantasizing and merit and that was one of the tips that they were giving is saying like you know if you notice someone attractive or have a thought that pops into your mind you don't have to like keep it and and continue to dwell on it you can just like it's almost like if you were just walking by it okay you keep moving on with your day you don't have to make it a big thing it doesn't have to become this huge ordeal but if you do find yourself in a place where you are kind of like dwelling on it or thinking about it i think that's where you really need to take the thought captive yes reject it and like replace it with truth and and all of that but i do just want to say i don't think that. At least in my opinion i don't think. Noticing you are attractive to is a sentence i like you said you can't help it like you live in this world you can't help what your i see it's the same like it's it's not the same but like even if you saw something that was sinful like an image that was like pornographic base then it's like okay you saw it now what do you do with that do you continue to look and dwell on it or do you immediately temptation like scripture talks about like flea that means get out of there turn away guard your heart your mind like you saw it but you don't have to keep seeing it if that makes sense this know they're not the same thing it's not like i saw it attractive person and that's a sinful thing i must flee my point is that seeing something even if it is sinful it doesn't become a sin until we actively choose to continue to look into well and it's the same what i think you're saying is you see an attractive person and you're married woman you see a man you're in starbucks you're in grocery store at your church wherever even on social media and you are you tempted to oh wow you think he's attractive and then what happens next and i think that is what you're getting at yeah just like with content that is sinful in the same way it can become sinful and if we go oh he is oh and then we keep browsing we keep staring or we look away but then later on in that day that man pops back up into our mind and then we start thinking hmm i wonder what it would be like to be married to him or oh just his you know fantasizing about how attractive he is and sexual things like you know i've even heard from women who the struggle of like. What if you know what if my husband died and like what if he died like you don't want that but you're like what if he died. Mary and almost going down a path of like fantasizing about other men that you would marry if your husband died so i think so much of it starts in our hearts and our emotions and as women being hypersensitive that to that to say lorde. Help me like in those moments guard my emotions and that's also where i think that community of christian sisters being honest with each other and saying look i'm really struggling emotionally in my heart in my thoughts i am wrestling with having these you know these fantasies about this particular man i've had a woman confess to me something exactly like that. She was saying you know he's a married man i am struggling with thoughts toward him i just find him really attractive i he's really godly there's nothing happening it was all in her heart and mine and she just said can you please pray for me and this and i thought. Wow i am so proud like that is the most courageous thing to be open and honest cuz it can feel so embarrassing and so icky and almost like if anyone knew i even wrestle with this like what would they think of me but. I think it's a common struggle that we all is christian women face yes for sure and i and in some ways so to take it in the same. Like take it a step further i found a lot of freedom and understanding this especially even when it comes to being married and living in a world with other attractive women because you think my husband season attractive woman like oh my gosh you know like you know it was first few years and you're just trying to figure out your marriage and this is another common thing a lot of what you might be thinking that to like there's this really godly beautiful woman in her small group and oh my husband you know and but it's the same thing like a man can notice a woman and her beauty but what does he do with it from there and so. You know him having good accountability good support just like us it's the same thing so we don't have to be afraid of other people we don't have to live in fear but we can acknowledge the beauty and other people but not dwell on it not stay there just move on just like we saw a beautiful rose okay now i'm moving on with my day it's not something beautiful rose and how great it is but you know what i'm saying like yeah ok google i mean so here's an example like maybe your grocery store situation yeah there's something like that and you're like this just makes me uncomfortable and i am tempted in this way you can always pick it up from grocery store you know that's true i will say when we finally moved out of that area and i started shopping at a different heb i was really really. I should have gone i should have started shopping somewhere else sooner but it wasn't a really big struggle for me but i will say i was released i didn't have to go there anymore something else that's been really helpful for me is having super open communication grows and we get stronger and i feel like even in our fourth year of marriage it's become even stronger to where we can even be honest about these things and share them and so there has been times where i have had like i feel like i've had an uncomfortable interaction. Sometimes i'm with my kids and i just wanted to someone who's from the pastor i know them and it's just kind of made me uncomfortable and there was a particular situation i don't think i've actually told you about that i'm wearing this i'm not going to share all the details because i don't want to give the person's identity away but i i was really feeling uncomfortable by someone that was very well-respected and was kind of a lot of people knew and i'm married this person is married and i was really starting to feel uncomfortable about my interactions with this person and with a man with a man. And i was starting to feel like they were really seeking me out and you know nothing officially happened but honestly like i didn't actually tell dave about that for a few months because i was really embarrassed because i thought i don't know i just thought this person is so well respected like i don't i don't know and you know sharing with dave though was one of the most freeing things i literally told him i was like i'm so embarrassed to like share this it just i don't know i feel uncomfortable and i don't know why i feel so embarrassed but i just feel so dumb and like. But i just let me share the situation with you and tell you what kind of has happened and dave was so kind and gracious and he was you know like really supportive and we were able to take some steps to kind of make sure that there was very clear signs that i wasn't giving this the you know the signals that good but i just want to encourage you to be open with your husband be open with godly women even if you feel like it's so dumb you're so embarrassed because that's how i felt in the past that there's so much freedom that happens when we bring things into the light yeah they haven't crossed over into sin yet just to know that there are people on our team that are on our side that want to pray for us and encourage us it just brings so much freedom so i just hope that encourages you to to be open with your husband about things that are going on even you know if you're tempted like okay maybe i won't tell him about that interaction maybe i won't like it's okay maybe share and your relationship can grow stronger and you can support one another and it doesn't you know it doesn't have to continue to be this embarrassing thing yeah. There was something that for sure this was years ago but you had mentioned the intimacy thing about like when your intimate intimate with your spouse and having fantasies of other men or just other maybe scenarios going on in your head and something i talked about a little bit but this was a really big impact of struggling with masturbation when i was unmarried and i talked a lot about that in our book sex purity and the longings of a girl's heart awesome book single or married just to build a biblical understanding of god's design for sexuality for every season and stage of life i encourage you check it out girl to find calm slash shop but in their i talk about my struggle with masturbation and it was very much fuel by lustful thoughts and fantasies and that's how i was aroused that's how you know you orgasm. In masturbation and so i thought well once i'm and i did eventually conquer that habitual thing that i had struggled with prior to marriage but i remember thinking once i married there won't be any effects of this that'll take with me into my marriage like i'll be able to enjoy sexual intimacy with my husband there will be no struggles like it'll be beautiful and awesome. And it was but there were struggles that i did not anticipate and i have since talked to a lot of women a lot of you who have said i don't know what to do about this like this is a struggle and i just feel so embarrassed like you said i feel awkward i don't know if i should talk to my husband about this and so for me what was happening. Is that my body physical body was so trained to be aroused by the fantasies that i had allowed into my heart and mind for years and my singleness that when i got married if they didn't just go away they didn't just disappear and of course the enemies not going to just let that temptation slide he's like oh no we're leaning into this one and so for me as i was intimate with my husband i would find my mind naturally wanting to go to those same fantasies that had aroused me before it was like almost like a physical reaction in my brain and my body and i remember struggling and thinking like. I thought this was going to go away and i felt so awkward and embarrassed i didn't want to have this struggle but it was like frequently when we were intimate this would come up in my heart and mine and so i struggled for months early on just like battling in my heart do i tell zack do i not i was praying like lord help me and like before moments of intimacy with him i would pray like god help me to take my thoughts captive to enjoy this man right in front of me and not these thoughts that are coming into my brain. And so it wasn't though until i finally had the courage. Look at the same kind of like you like i'm. I don't really know like how to say this i feel really awkward and like honestly just kind of like ashamed but. I'm struggling in my mind like when were intimate and i just want you to know like i'm i'm trying to fight it i'm asking god for help would you please pray for me in this and i didn't really know how he was going to be like respond if he was going to want more details like well tell me everything what's going on and how long has this been happening and you know we talked about it a little more but he wasn't interested in like every detail he just said yes that's probably good we don't need to share every last detail but just enough to where he knows what's going on i'm being transparent with him in our marriage it's this this in my heart and mind this is affecting our intimacy it's affecting our oneness affecting our covenant like i need to involve him in this and he's not going to know unless i tell him and so telling him and having him on my team in a supporting me praying for me and i said would you ask me like every few weeks how i'm doing like just knowing i would have the accountability. I said i want you to ask me so you can like help me. I eventually later on shared it with the ladies that were in my small group which took a lot of guts because i remember for months god was pressing it on my heart like. Share like be transparent and i'm like no no no no like that's it's fine i don't need you and i'm not saying you have to share its you take that before the lord that things are struggling with but for me i'm like i want to i want to support and help and encouragement of the christian women in my life and so even sharing that in my small group with the ladies it was amazing the conversations that it started of other women saying i've had similar struggles or not that sexual something different and just the openness that we were able to have with each other to pray for each other in this particular way as married women was huge and i just remember feeling like oh this is the body of christ like this is what we're meant to be for one another we're not meant to bear these birds alone so i just want to encourage you if you're in that place as a married woman to share it with your husband asked god for the courage and do it to share it with a trusted christian sister you know in your small group a close friend that you know will pray for you and support you because looking back i have no regrets that i opened up about it and in fact it is helped me that after purity and my heart in my marriage fight for the oneness of my marriage to have that kind of support i think most of you are wondering like okay what our next steps what do you know where can i find support so i think maybe we can just share a few things that have helped us or resources that we really like obviously gaining a really really good understanding of god's design for sexuality of god's design for true intimacy which you already mentioned sex security in the longings of a girl's heart you have to start there because if you don't understand as a christian woman god's design for sex god's design for intimacy the greater purpose for it all then it's just you know we're kind of like i don't know putting band-aids on things just like a list of do's and don'ts but like where does it really stem from yeah like i mentioned during married couple justice like it was only like a 15 minute podcast episode but it was really good specifically on this so i'll link that below or you can go to their you know during married couple podcast and then for me another resource that has been so life changing is francis in your home i you know literally just started at the beginning and i have listened to the majority of her episodes and they have been so helpful she's all about you know helping married women understand how true amazing intimacy in their marriage is and she like goes to all the places interviews all the most amazing people really really helps you think through some of these very personal very you know difficult scenarios and she actually offers she calls it i don't know what's the discipleship circle i don't exactly know the name of it but if you just go to heaven in your home search heaven in your home on google and she has that's the main thing she offers it's like a community for women exactly in these videos that were talking about to have a trusted community yeah and she personally disciples the women in that community and so that would be an amazing step that you could take and i know it's difficult like you had a good godly group of women right here these things with anyone it does yes to communities yeah i'm not sure if you have a trusted community finding something like this like fancy winslow's you know you just circle of godly sisters that could be a great place so those are things that i would definitely recommend and resources that have helped me i would recommend something we always recommend which is getting a mentor having someone that is a real life person that's an older godly woman doesn't mean she has to be like really old but just older and wiser and godly someone that you feel like this is my person like. Those resources those same ones bethany mentioned like there's so many amazing things that we could tap into that we often don't because we're just like i just have to struggle and we just keep struggling alone but we don't ever speak up we don't share our struggle we don't take steps to get help we don't take action we are honest and so that's what the enemy loves the most is to keep us trapped in darkness since the rise in darkness we feel isolated alone we feel so ashamed and that's right where the enemy wants us but god talks so often in scripture about how freedom is found when we walk in the light when we bring things into the open and say i'm actually struggling with it like can we talk about it with that trusted godly mentor going through you know that fancy winslow court like circle of mentors like whatever it's called it's like it's just stuff that we can take advantage of so a godly mentor asking an older woman like could you mentor me and maybe there's even a book. You know that you would like i'm thinking of julie slattery. What is her i'm holy sexuality. That is one is her most recent one it's called holy sexuality i thought for sure it was called holy sexuality ok google she has authentic intimacy which is another podcast that i wanted to recommend so amazing tons of articles and blogs which i frequently refer to when i get questions or even in certain mentoring relationships i'm in i'm regularly going to their website and like okay check out this article this really helped me copy paste like it's going to be super helpful personally learned so much from her job yeah her ministry is four women all about sexuality sex intimacy she has content on like everything so amazing and then her latest book i thought it was called holy sexuality it's like god in your marriage and like why sex matters like sex in your marriage yeah something like that okay we're going to get we're going to get it right in the end maybe but it's a really great book for married women for married couples to understand like why sex the gospel how was all connected why it matters like you were saying having that foundation is so important and then again you mentioned our book sex period and the longings of a girl's heart just an easy read it's accessible it's down to earth it's each of our journeys and coming totally understand god's design in and out of our different struggles knowing that last it's not just a man's struggle it's a woman struggle to for single and married women how do we battle how do we fight how do we go to scripture for truth how do we got our emotions by god's word and so there's amazing resources please just choose a few and start tapping into them don't continue battling these things alone but surround yourself with wise people with great resources i know that god wants to use those to really grow you and grow your heart and there's actually a few that you could take advantage of right now we have written several emails on you know battling sexual struggles battling life and you can actually get those for free by joining our patreon so girl.com.
