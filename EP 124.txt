It is skyrocketed this social media platform over the past few years really over the pandemic some of you know exactly what we're talking about in some of you are like only fans what in the world is that it is a platform that is turned highly sexual and really pornographic and we are seeing college age girls especially jump on this platform to make money and. A lot of them just aren't thinking of the future in the consequences and just what can happen as a result of it and so we just want to bring some light to only fans what's actually going on what the reality is like how much money can you actually make on this platform is it worth it like should i jump on this we're going to go there today and hopefully open your eyes to a better way what's up guys it's kristen and bethany and audrey and audrey we have her family the youngest of the sisterhood we jokingly call her what do we say hey google she can't really understand what's going on or trust me it would not be appropriate for her to hear quite yet but yeah we are going to dive into this because it is becoming so incredibly popular we're going to bring some stats actually of how popular it was when it first came out and like over the pandemic how only fans has absolutely exploded and i think many of you have heard of it i will be honest until recently i didn't really know what it was yeah so i know some of you listening are like well i have no idea i have i just been really out of the loop that's okay if you don't know what it is you will by the end of this and hopefully you'll be able to see how dangerous it is how damaging and sadly how normal things like this are becoming and we're told us women to just view it as completely normal so as we jump into that conversation though.

Okay so only fans first i'm going to tell you like. How i came across this topic and why i decided. Organization that fights human trafficking all over the world and it was really fascinating conversation because it was two women one who used to be in the sex industry and another one who just is on the front lines helping fight human trafficking across the world and they were actually having a debate. With two men who are currently or very. Pornography pro sex work and so it was a really fascinating conversation i really appreciated these women being so bold and taking such a like strong stance of just the harm and the dangers and just you know the reality of it and during that conversation though they started talking about only fans and the reality of it and so we started researching more into okay what exactly is only fans i mean how would. Social media platform that presents itself as a paid subscription platform where you can and this is true you can you pay to be a fan of different people and that person who has an account if you're the creator you can pick whatever amount you want to charge and then people pay to be your fans your only fans but the the thing that i find so repulsive about it is that only fans advertises itself as like a social media platform where you can come on and show your amazing creative artwork like your photography and like you're amazing skills or your art and people are going to pay you to see it but in reality behind the scenes the majority the highest percentage of type of content that sells on only fans and what most people actually know it to be for is sexual content so basically people selling images videos of their bodies and their fans paying to see that so it's a social media platform that is basically it's a sex business yeah geared toward college age young people so i mean that's a lot of people who aren't so it's interesting we found some a video and some comments by a woman named harmony. Grillo she probably it's probably different than that but that's how i'm going to say it and actually molly shout out to molly she does a lot of research for us she found a lot of this which it's so amazing having a team but harmony describes only fans this way she says on the surface starting an only fans might seem like a simple thing turn on your camera post a picture of a video get some subs and make some money in reality this is a serious decision that can have a lasting impact on your heart mind and future i know this this is harmony speaking because i am a survivor of the commercial sex industry and i have spent nearly two decades walking alongside other women as they have thought to find healing and freedom from the sex industry she goes on to say i have never heard anything more vile crude abusive and degrading then comments from people who believe someone exists for their personal gratification essentially becoming a sexual object is an experience of being dehumanized when you think about it some of the most atrocious acts in human history have been committed as a result of dehumanizing another person or people group and i just appreciate her comments so much because one she's been in the sex industry she's you know basically sold her body for money and she's saying like this it kind of like appears like i'm just going to post some cute pics but she's saying no like this is the most dehumanizing the most abusive like the worst thing that you can do for yourself is you know exchange your body for dollars as someone who has been in it she sharing that and so we have some other stuff that we're going to share but just you know the reason we're talking about is because only fans is in a simple platform it's not another social media platform like oh i can have subscribers on instagram like no this is not the same thing and if you're in the demographic that's being heavily recruited to post on this college age girl specifically they're going after you because they know you need money to get through college and it's so enticing it's like just posted a few pics they can be the same ones you even posted on instagram make some money life will be so much easier when we like i mean the number show like the average only fans personal only makes like $120 a month or something yeah really really low out of all the people it's very very few people who are making those big millions of bucks but those are the stories we hear about so it's like oh my goodness you're just posting pics and then you're making millions of dollars like know that is such a lie that is not actually happening and so we're just here to like sound the alarm bells and to say no this is so much more serious and we hope that if you've ever considered getting on it or you know someone who has or you are on it that maybe you'll just rethink this as a christian woman and make decisions that will be one i believe so much more honoring to god in line with who god created you to be as his beautiful daughter that he cares for so much and also just to set yourself up for a future that i think you will. What attracts someone. What is so attractive about this platform that makes literally i mean i've got to find that statistic where it was how many people were on it before the pandemic versus after the pandemic we'll see if we can grab it here in just a second but it was shocking like the numbers it was like $90,000 or something pre-pandemic up to like over a million people that were using this after the pandemic and so what a lot of articles that we read and research we did said is that during the pandemic there was obviously a lot of loss write a lot of people lost their jobs the entire service industry basically went dark for a while so people that were waiters and waitresses and just drops in the service industry everything halted and college people who were working on campus to pay for their rights had to come home to school online and had no more work to. They saw that there was this gap that there was a need for work and so they started i mean it just kind of took off whether it was their advertising or word of mouth people talking about it but clearly there were some strategy on the part of this company to recruit these young college people who were desperate for work and it sounds up front it can sound so good like you were talking about like oh i can take the same kind of content i'm posting on instagram and i can just come over to only fans and i can post some pictures and make some money and it's advertised like you're going to somehow be able to pay your college tuition with this but like bethany was saying that's the lie that they get you in with and they make you think oh okay you're you're this beautiful young woman you're posting bikini pics on your instagram in fact one article on the girl was talking about that she had been on there and shared her experience and basically i think regretted it ultimately in the end but was saying i'm already posting these beginning you know bikini pics over on instagram why not just come over on onlyfans and make some money off of it but at the end of the day the amount of money that she made was so little in comparison and we're going to get some more of this in a minute about how it doesn't end there it starts there with bikini pics but that is not where it ends that's not what the fans on their want to see they want to see a lot more your pressure to show a lot more than you ever thought but just to give you an idea of how much money people are actually making on here because it sounds so much better than it really is so the average account earns just 220 dollars per month wow. To the average so that means there are people who make more obviously and people who make even less than that creator so if you're a creator on their typically they charge anywhere from $750 to $75 for a monthly subscription which means that you need between 3 and 30 subscribers to earn only $220 and i know that might seem like a lot like oh that's so easy i mean i have like 1000 subscribers on instagram how hard can it be but here's another stop from the tech jerry site they said the average only fans content creator only. Has 21 subscribers so that just goes to show you that what's being advertised as this amazing way like yeah i just post a few bikini pics and you're going to be making thousands of dollars to support yourself that's really not the case that's not what's happening so molly like we said our research assistant she actually typed something up and she put her notes for us and i thought it was so good that i actually want to read it right now because it just brought a great perspective she was saying that in her research almost all of the sources i found and personal stories of only fans experiences were from non-believers it really says something if the secular world is expressing how degrading yeah and damaging only fans is it definitely paints a picture of regret and despair many young women are being scammed into believing they can post a couple of sexy pictures stay within their personal boundaries and make millions but only a handful of accounts have actually made that much money and much like pornography it's like a drug once you get used to it you only crave more so girls are pressured into compromising their morals more and more to keep their subscribers hooked and paying money it's downright exploitative. They're turning to what they believe is a surefire way to make some extra dough and initially it may work well for them but before long they're fighting to keep their subscribers engaging in hundreds of personal messages selling private pictures to subscribers and compromising their standards again and again many women who began accounts with a strict no nudity policy end up selling and posting nudes i just thought that was a great overview of what's actually happening on and like i love that point that she pointed out like all of the sources she was finding these aren't from believers saying like oh yes you know god's design know these are from non-believers people who don't believe in god saying like this is so damaging this is so degrading like not even as christians just as unbeliever saying we this is so terrible like don't engage in this this is so damaging don't do this i mean that has got to say something yeah i mean that is when the world obviously not the only fans world when the general population like society is looking at this and actually recognizing the damage that this house on men and women and something really interesting and this isn't surprising at all but a majority of the content creators on only fans are women and the majority of consumers are men now there are some men who are like who have accounts to our creators but it's just it's a much smaller percentage so here we see again this idea like oh it's freedom it's women it's empowering like make some money just you know post a few pictures and and here we have like basically your own social media version of pornography i mean that's exactly what it is and i think even some women who might think well yeah you know pornography has a certain stigma but only fans does it that that's actually not the case we're going to get into some of that in a minute the long term effects not only on your self personality but also on your future and like for women things that you might want to pursue down the road how choosing to participate in the sex industry in this way could come back to haunt you and i mean that's not that should not be our driving motivation as christians for why we shouldn't do this but it's like still we need to be thinking of this and something like if i could put it in a phrase i would say this about only fans that it is on degradation sexualization and objective vacation and that is absolutely true that it is built on dead like the degradation of women. Promising that you're going to find this amazing opportunity to work from home flexible hours you don't have to have like any particular skills just post pictures that get people's attention you're going to get fans and it's presented as this amazing thing but it is degrading to the female body degrading to our design as sexual beings degrading to sex itself and the intentions that god has for creating sex what it's for this beautiful celebration of covenant love within marriage and it's completely degraded to a commodity so something that can be sold to you are you are no more than an object i mean that's really what it is and that's the objectification part of it that we are. We are buying into this lie that we are more empowered as women by objectifying ourselves and selling our bodies for just a little bit of money and that somehow we're going to be better off in the end or that there's going to be no effect that it's going to be neutral but as we've read testimony after testimony of women who have been in the sex industry who have gotten out of it that is not the case really for any of them it isn't it does not leave you in a neutral state at the end and then just a sexualization obviously it's all based on sex and just literally abusing sex misusing it mistreating it it's just so sad and so as christians just stepping back and saying what's going on like what is this really what i want to be a part of is this really healthy for my soul for my future is this going to impact intimacy down the road like yes and so why don't we just run through some of those things that hillary or sorry harmony you had some quotes from her earlier she has an amazing video like you said we'll link her video below all the credit goes to. Putting your hope in the fact that it's going to stay private is a very naive perspective honestly i mean people have to like the most secure things and in the world like of course people can get your content they can take screen recordings they can take videos of it so don't put your insurance in the fact that it's going to be private so that would be the second thing she mentioned is that you will always be asked to do more and this is something else that people don't know about only fans oftentimes just looking from the outside is that. You are interacting with your fan so all the people who are only your fans but they interact and they they're not just like giving you thumbs up and stuff they can give you tips they can request more and on only fans are highly encouraged to interact with your fans that's how you keep them that's how you maintain your subscriptions and so you're not only encouraged to interact with them but you're encouraged to do what they're asking so if you're fans are like oh love that you know of course it's interesting the first few times but then they're going to want more they're going to want to see more they're going to want you to take off more and so that's the lie is that you get on you think it's just going to be this one little you know these kind of pictures but that's not the case because your fans they're on their buying sex from you and you are an object to them and now they're demanding more from you what happens every time and number three again these are from how many gorillas we'll link up low she says the money is not as good as you think and that's so true just the stats you know it's always presented like you know even out on facebook these videos pop up like only fans success story it's like i don't even care about only fans maybe you know your phone's hearing these days and then they give you ads so maybe it has no no only dance but you know it's all these success stories like i made millions and one month and so people think like oh my goodness you know i'm going to make that much but the reality is it's like you know 200 and under for a month for average subscriber i mean the average content creator is making and that is just not good money and you're selling your body for those you know few hundred bucks so it's just the that is such a lie like the money. Share this herself as someone who previously worked in the sex industry and she just shared her own testimony of saying that it changes the way you view yourself it changes the way you view sex the way that you view the world when you choose to become willingly by your own choice to become an object and a sex object where people are paying you to show them and give them sexually essentially she's saying it like there's a cost to that and for her it's been a journey as she has worked through that in her own heart it's very dehumanizing she said and it really changed the way that she viewed herself her worth her value her sexuality so it's not neutral it will have an impact and that's one of the biggest lies that we have to get over and recognize like there is a cost number five reasons not to have an onlyfans is because sexual harassment is a job requirement literally from the comments and the fan interaction like that is part of your job is to basically be harassed sexually by these people that are your subscribers and like she's saying when you objectify yourself like that you're opening yourself up to that they can call you whatever you want they can request whatever they want from you they can you know they literally are just there to get more from you so they're going to harass you they're going to objectify you and it's all so like you said humanizing and degrading but just knowing that's that's what you're signing up for when you sign up for only fans you're saying yes i'm okay with the sexual harassment number six is stalkers so this is all so a very real thing is that because it's virtual i think we have this. Does naive sense that because it's online it's not me right it's like my other identity it's the work i do maybe there's even another name that you use it's not really who i am and it's not going to impact my real life but what statistics have found is that women who engage in this kind of sex work. I'm often will find these guys who aren't satisfied with just having the online interaction but will actually stopped them sometimes virtually right like stalking you in other places on the internet other spaces that you're in or in real life you know because. Anyone can find you on there right like anyone can subscribe and become your fan and so. This is also a huge problem is that you get these really super creepy guys who are only after one thing and very warped perspectives on everything and they are now stalking you which is super scary so we need to be aware of that and the seventh reason not to get on only fans or to start only fans is because it really can interfere with your future goals so if you are wanting to work with children one day maybe as a teacher you're wanting to work for the government people will find this out about you you know they can jobs who are serious about protecting the kids or need some of the highest you know the highest you know just caliber reputation this stuff can come back to be a reason why you could not get hired in the future so if you're like okay i'm in college and i have these dreams of having this highly respectable job just consider that your history of doing this might be a reason that you might not be able to get the job and and serve the people in the future that you really want to yeah number eight and i already touched on this earlier is that it will change you like i said it sex work it changes the way that you view the world and that you view yourself and i think one of the things that it impacts the most that we don't often think about is how it will impact our intimacy for real life relationships so you're young you're like i'm in the prime of my life i'm beautiful i'm just going to do this for right now make a few bucks and i'll get off it's no problem but not realizing the impact that sex work selling your body for money how that can impact your view of intimacy and what real beautiful godly intimacy is within marriage and so even if it's a couple years down the road five ten years down the road you get married and there is evidence to show that sex work for women impacts the way that they engage with their husband one day in this loving beautiful relationship and so just be thinking ahead of like how are these choices i'm making now going to impact my view of sexuality and eventually one day even affect my marriage and then 93 reason is that you can't take it back like the internet you know the videos they are there forever so even if you're like okay i'm just like you know 21 22 in college like it's not that big of a deal you know okay one day when you are 3548 and you have kids and you know those videos those pictures are there forever and you have to really think do i want this around in 20 years so i want this round in 40 years is this something that i want you know my future children to see my future daughters to see is this something that i want if i'm able to some you know i'll get like that teaching job is this something that i want the children that i'm teaching the people that i'm trying to help to come across one day and you have to face that reality so the last thing number 10 even if the money is good the price is high the price is so high and industry that choose you up and spits you back out you're in the end you're really only left with trauma that's what so many women have come forward to say woman who are out of sex work saying. Spits you out you are you are an object you are just a piece of matter to be used to satisfy the warped sexual gratification of of the viewers the subscribers and then when you're done that's it it's over and you are left with trauma you are left with struggles and issues and now you have to work through those you have to somehow get through those and sadly so many women are not able to and it takes them to very dark and sad places so we just have to recognize that so if these ten reasons didn't convince you which i really hope you are convinced and notice that so far and these ten reasons there wasn't even a single thing mentioned about. I hope you are so like your eyes are so opened and you're seeing now more clearly than ever that just by the glam the glitz the promises of this platform that it is garbage it is trash and you want really nothing to do with it well and you might think i don't know anyone that's on and that's what they've said in all of the research that we've come across is that. I don't know anyone like i absolutely don't know anyone who's on you might you know maybe. And you know conversations especially if you're in this kind of demographic this college age demographic maybe you work with college girls or you're in like a bible study maybe this is something that you can bring up or share with your group like send this podcast out because you never know your friend or someone that you like this might be something that could really help them find freedom so yeah just an encouragement to you even if you don't think you know anyone that on it share it with your friends share it with people because i we want this message to get out so turning to god's word i just want to read one or two scriptures that help remind us as women of what are like where are should be in all things like talking about only fans our sexuality but really are identity as daughter of god as believers and i just really love second corinthians 5:17 it's just paints this beautiful picture it says therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the oldest passed away behold the new has come and it's just such a beautiful reminder that as women as christian women we are adopted by god we are giving a new identity a new inheritance we are a part of a new family a new body the body of christ and we are giving a new i said a new identity that who we were before a broken lost sinner desperately in need of a savior we have now been saved by christ and he's clothed us in his righteousness and brought us into his family through that spiritual adoption and it's just the most beautiful thing and so second corinthians is telling us therefore because of these things if you are in christ you need to remember that you are a new creation the old ways of living the sinful ways the world you always following the flash doing what feels go to listening to the advice of the world falling after the patterns of patterns of the world. That is no longer the identity the things that we should be walking in behold the new has come. Cancel my encouragement to all of us as christian women and even thinking about only fans is going on to a platform participating in something that that just completely dehumanizes women and anyone men who are on their it objectifies people it creates its sexualizes things in the most degrading way god is saying you are a new creation that's darkness that's put that behind you you a daughter of the light walk in truth walk in light walk in your new identity as one who was been saved by the savior and walk in that and so that's just my encouragement to say like god has a beautiful plan for us as daughters of god i want to jump in on that i was thinking because we're both mom's now yeah so i think like okay you know i have a little girl now and i love her so much like i would give my life for her i know you will and for my son to she's right here so i think about it and i'm like i would do anything for her i love her so much and i am just. A broken human myself you know i'm just a sinner i need to save your you know my love is not perfect like christ and i think wow like i want the best for audrey and i am not perfect and i still want so much for her and i think like wow i want i want like her to have the best life possible to know how loved she is and how cared for she is and i want her to just understand that in her heart of hearts anything wow. God loves us so much more than that and he wants so much more for us you know then just selling our bodies or thinking we're only as good as what other people will pay for us to do and you know he's called us his children it's like we are adopted into his family we are you know his identity like you're saying it just breaks my heart so much because i'm like god loves us so much like we don't have to do this like we can find so much hope and peace and purpose in him and that's just amazing you know when he welcomes us with open arms his forgiveness is so great his love is so great i mean he sent jesus to the cross while we were still sinners not while we were perfect we don't have to earn his love we don't have to earn salvation and that's just so yes beautiful as i think of that so no matter where you're coming from right now i don't care if you've been on only fans or you've never like we all need this we all need his sacrifice it is resurrection so i just want to encourage you with that no matter where you're coming from we can all go to jesus for forgiveness and there can be a line in the sand today yeah right like if you have been engaging in sexual immorality things that you know are of the darkness it's not walking in the light you can today say god i repent of that i want to walk in a way to you that glorifies you that reflects my life as a redeemed daughter of god. Please help me i repent i asked her forgiveness and i want to walk a new path today don't do it alone though you know we're all about mentorship find that godly woman that you can walk. Can you bring her alongside you in that journey and invite her into that but yeah every single day god's mercies are new and every single day is a new opportunity for us to repent of our sins and say god please forgive me i want to walk a new path that honors you one chapter later so i read second corinthians actually one book earlier first corinthians and one chapter six 18 through 20 for just this reminder that because we're god's daughters we are as christian women we have a new identity that we do have commands to flee sexual immorality and i love that word flea because it's not just like look away you know try to avoid it's like fully that means like far away is you can't and so this first corinthians 6:30 through 2:20 just reminds us no matter how normal the world makes things to be this is what our god says to us flee sexual immorality every other kind of person commits is outside the body but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit within you. Whom you have from god you are not your own for you were bought with a price so glorify god in your body. How interesting that word price is right here we are being told by the world we it's okay jump on sell a few pictures of yourself do a few nudes make a few bucks and here's our savior the perfect one thing don't do that flea that that's darkness that is not life i bought you i paid for you with my own life dying on the cross that is worth so much more than what this world has to offer therefore glorify god in your body you were bought with a price like such an amazing contrast and like yes don't we want to run toward the arms of our loving savior whose arms were stretched out on the cross on the one who bought us with a very costly price like. That is that's the place so rest and refuge and truth and hope in life i hope this message has been encouraging again share it and we want you to know that you can take the next step of learning and growing right now our book sex period and the longings of a girl's heart discovering the beauty and freedom of god define sexuality will give you that foundation of truth god's truth and just his design for why he made you a sexual being his design for sex his design for intimacy understanding that is so yes important and life-changing so whether you're single dating married sex purity and the longings of a girl's heart is like the most you need to start to really take a deep dive and you can get that girl to find calm slash shop and if you appreciated this please leave us a five stars like we want this message to get out there like we want more people to hear this beyond just even the current so when you leave a five star when you leave a review it really actually bumps us up so people who are just searching organically will find it and then we want to give you some some free stuff to to leave here so if you're like yes i want more resources i want to dig into all of the things you'll have created i really want to learn and grow i want to grab you know the the newest guy that you'll created how to how do i know if he's the one you can get that all by becoming one of our patrons so you go to patron.com find and that's our inner circle our inner sisterhood of you who have said i am going to play a dollar or two dollars per podcast per video to keep this channel going to keep this amazing resource available for others so all you have to do is go to patreon.com go to find and as soon as you sign up you get access to all of our products that we've created does it doesn't have digital ebooks digital resources that are all available in our shop but you get them for free so go to patriot.com to find we love you all so much and you will hear from us again next week.
