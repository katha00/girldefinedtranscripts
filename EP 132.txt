Today on the girl defined show we are talking about masturbation masturbation is something that i actually actually struggled with a lot as a single woman and for me it was very much driven by lust it was driven by fantasy and in my heart i know what i was doing wasn't honoring to god i know it wasn't in his design for me and pursuing purity and holiness but i didn't know how to break free as a single woman i didn't know how to understand my body i didn't know how to embrace god's design from my sexuality i didn't understand how to truly pursue purity as he intended and i know as i've talked to so many of you you have the same question questions and i was a married woman i have more questions on the other side of marriage regarding my sexual design and so when today's episode we are going to be talking about all of that masturbation how to think about it as a married woman as a single woman what is god's word say about this how do we embrace god's design for our sexuality without falling into any of the ditches we're going to dive in to all of that today on the girl to find show what's up y'all it's bethany and kristen here and i am really excited for this conversation on masturbation i don't know if you've noticed but it seems that christian women particularly are very silent on this topic and i think that's why when you and i kristen post and talk about masturbation from like a biblical lens. The comments the dms the click rate on those posts like skyrocketing and i think it's because we as christian women are desperate for information. About her sexuality about our struggles about what like what does the bible say is you know a. Living out of our sexuality what is against god's design like we just have so many questions and it can be so hard to find answers and we all know. Going to good old google can bring up some real sketchy stuff it's most of us don't really want to google like oh my phone with masturbation cuz we're like i don't know what's going to pop up and i don't really want to go to secular sources i want someone who's going to take me to scripture but it can be hard so here we are and really what triggered this conversation is we actually just released a guide. A digital download on the topic of masturbation the the guide is called finding freedom from masturbation gospel strategies for walking in victory and as you can see this. Ebook this pdf download is for the woman who is like wow this i am kind of like trapped in this or this is. I know this isn't honoring to the lord this is something that is filled with like lust and fantasy and i just i know this is not where i want to be like i want to break free from this and i want helpful strategies that's what we created finding freedom for masturbation for for the single or married woman for you to get for a friend and just to be bold about this topic and say i'm not gonna let. You know satan trap me in this in my own little island and and keep this secret all to myself like i am going to confess this to the lord i'm going to find a mentor someone to help me walk through this i'm going to get this guy i'm going to start taking those steps so this guy is actually available right now at girl to find calm slash will link it directly below so you can go straight there but yeah we're excited i have a lot of you know anonymous questions dms that came in over the past weekend that we're going to we're going to unpack this is not going to be your typical conversation on masturbation right because oh no it's so interesting because when we released our pdf i think we were even blown away by how many people were not only purchasing it but dming us like you said emailing us and having follow-up questions and you know is there something i should get or i have questions as a married woman or i'm a single christian woman here's my struggle will this relate to me will this help me just so many nuances right and i think we were even kind of blown away because this isn't the first time we've ever talked about this we've had i had an episode specifically on masturbation that came out a while ago sharing my whole journey my struggle my journey to freedom what that looked like and then we've talked about this we have a whole section in our book sex purity and the longings of a girl's heart we have an entire section on this as well and we've talked about it in other ways you just on instagram and so it's not the first time but we've never released a resource that was specifically. Just about masturbation and finding freedom and so clearly there is a cord being struck here this is resonating this is something that we see as a christian community women saying i need this i want this i'm confused about this or i'm struggling with this or i have questions about this and i need answers and sadly when you look out at the christian resource what's available out there there isn't a ton of resources on this specific topic. Specifically addressed to women. There are a lot of resources i think for men cuz oftentimes sexual struggles sadly can be viewed more as a man's issue and a man's topic but as women we know we are just as sexual as men we are also created a sexual beings and god has a beautiful design for our sexuality but we're also broken because of the fall because of sin and so we wrestle and we struggle and we need more resources for women helping us link arms journey together to feel like i'm not alone i'm not on an island my struggles don't have to remain a secret i can bring them into the light i can get help and that is exactly why we created this resource so that we can come alongside you and say you're not alone let's go on this journey together. Yes oh my goodness. I think it would be helpful though if we start with some definitions because that's what i have found in this conversation that people are very confused like what are we talking about and many of us we think if i say the word masturbation here's exactly what i'm talking about but if you got ten ten of us as women in the same room we might all have different definitions. Lay the foundation let's get some clarity on exactly what we are talking about when we use the word masturbation i don't have. I have it pulled up. Yeah so according to the dictionary here is how masturbation is defined. The stimulation or manipulation of one's own genitals especially to orgasm. Sexual self gratification. And i think that is a very basic very helpful to definition to just say okay as we approach this topic and this conversation right now that is the working definition that i would say we're going off of that is how we would define masturbation in this conversation so i'm going to read it one more time so if you missed it you can really hear what we're saying here the stimulation or manipulation of one's own genitals especially to orgasm sexual self-gratification. And in a minute we are going to get into breaking down some nuances of how this could play out in from married women and for single women because something that i think we have made the mistake of here in our conversations even as a ministry is that we haven't been super clear on. Kind of drawing a line and having this discussion for married women and how that might impact and look different within a marriage covenant relationship between a husband and wife versus a single woman who was unmarried and god's call for a christian single woman and her sexuality and god's call for a married woman and her sexuality there are distinctions there are differences clearly because we know sex was designed for marriage we're going to get into that so in this conversation we're going to break into some of those nuances that we haven't touched on before and a lot of this was burned on because so many of you were asking questions as married women and ask single women so we want to talk to each group today and i think that's going to be really helpful yeah for sure and i think part of that is our ministry really did start as a ministry for single women so our audience has been very clear so in past conversations we very much been talking to single women but as that's so true as chris and i have gotten married and have babies and our ministry has just evolved and we have a ton of married women now like it's kind of. You know 50/50 we've got like 50% married women 50% single women and so there's there's no way to have a conversation just to you know like to say here's here's something and this applies to everyone in this context so i'm really excited that you're single we are going to have a segment specifically for you in this conversation and then married women all of those nuances those questions you have we are going to give you some answers but i think it's important to note that. The word masturbation is not. Found in scripture so that's why we went to the dictionary to find our definition and i think that's part of the reason it can be a little bit scary to talk about this because we do not want to add to scripture in any way we do not want to speak for scripture in in ways it does not speak and so my hope is that by the end of this conversation you'll actually see the freedom and the beauty of god's design and you will won't live in fear but you'll be able to know hey this is god's good design in his boundaries for me in different seasons and i can thrive in that and outside of what he clearly says is honoring to him or not honoring to him send or not i'll know how to walk and freedom and i think that that's the beauty of this conversation is less of okay we just want to bring the hammer on anyone who struggling like no we christ has set us free we can find freedom in him and we can walk him and we can enjoy as married women intimacy in the right contacts a single woman you can we can use our lives and such incredible ways and so i think that you're going to walk away today and just go wow like i am excited for the season and i have practical strategies to combat sin i have practical strategies to know how to live out my sexuality well like i just think this is going to be a really freeing conversation. You know i wish that when i was younger when i was a single woman i wish that i had had more of a. Biblical gospel-centered framework for understanding god's design for sexuality because as i wrestled in my own struggles with masturbation and like i said in the intro for me if they were definitely very less fueled and fantasy driven they were not i knew it wasn't a pure act i knew it wasn't as a christian single woman i know it wasn't honoring to god and i knew his call for me was holiness and i you know i knew sex was for marriage and sexual acts but i didn't i didn't have that greater more beautiful picture and so for me there was a lot of shame of just like how come i can't stop i didn't feel like i had the tools i didn't have that greater understanding and so for me it was so much of like i just need to stop this but i didn't really have anything i was aiming for like that bigger more beautiful picture and so let's just give that recap because i think it is so important like that is foundational whether you're single married whether you're ever going to get married or whether you've already been married for a while like we need these reminders we need to go back to the bible and understand that god is the author of sex it wasn't something hollywood invented it wasn't you know it's like this was actually god's design and if we take a moment to like so like let that soak in will realize that god is for pleasure that he created sexual intimacy that he this thing that can sometimes even feel like a dirty word in the church is something our holy and pure an awesome god actually invented himself and so it's not something we have to be afraid of it's not something we have to be hush-hush shy about it's something that interests in marriage in any stage of life we need to understand god's design for this biblically what it was created for. And how to embrace it rightly so going back to genesis this is when we see first glimpses of sexual intimacy entering the scene right. Genesis 1 and 2 we see this beautiful picture of god creating the world of god creating the man first so you see the mail come on the scene and then you see god giving the man he's fully sexual he is a full grown man he's not a child he's not a baby he is a 100 percent full grown man with all the parts like god made him that way that's how he came into this world he was fully sexual. Yes everything but he was alone. And while he was alone god gives him responsibilities god is setting up some of these beautiful complimentary gender distinctions we see this in genesis it's a beautiful thing god giving him roles responsibilities helping him learn how to be a leader how to embrace that rightly and then god brings along this woman who is a full grown woman she comes from the man right from the rib it's incredible she's part of him that symbolizes that unity that they have that oneness like she literally came from his body she is fully woman she is not a child she is not an adolescent she is a full grown woman with all the hormones all the estrogen all of the sex drive all of that she's fully woman. Fully developed and i'm sure adam was just like. Wow this is a good day when she came on the scene so here you have to. Flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman for she was taken from the man and then the two verses let me just read these real quick and then you keep going but genesis 2:24 says that is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife and they become one. Flash. Speaking of. Togetherness they are united they are sexually together they are one. Adam and his wife were both naked and they felt. No shame like yo this is in the bible like this is the very beginning this is before there was any sin god is saying that they become one flesh they're both naked there's no shame like this beautiful sexual relationship even before the fall like. Crazy that sex was a part of god's good design for his perfect creation. Yes it wasn't something that came after the fall like okay now your sexual beings and it's this dirty bad thing that happened after sin entered the world know it was there and in fact it was the most beautiful perfect version of sex that the world has ever known because it wasn't distorted by sin there was no impact of sin on their relationship yet there was no shame there was no deceptiveness there was no like they were 100% vulnerable and intimate and open and it was beautiful and perfect in every way and oh man i think every married woman would say wow amen to that like i wish we could go back to that place but we can't and one day god will restore and make all things new butt. So here we have it adam and eve this perfect beautiful relationship completely sexual and like you said it was a part of god's original design be fruitful and multiply you know they were naked and unashamed like. They were intimate they were one like this is a picture of sex and it's such a beautiful thing and we see what god is doing here he didn't just throw sex into the world give us all sex drives make a sexual and then be like figure it out like just whatever you know almost animalistic like just follow your sex drive to its end no god actually had beautiful parameters beautiful boundaries a beautiful setting up a place where sex could thrive you know just like a fish thrives in water you take it out it struggles and then eventually does it make it it's like sex is set with any beautiful parameter where god is saying. This is where this beautiful intimate most vulnerable act that you would ever have as a human this nakedness this is its place to thrive in a relationship between a husband and wife and this covenant this lifelong unit union between a man and a woman something else that has become very confused and our society today we see god clearing up so much of the confusion right there in genesis 1 and 2 giving us this picture and so that is the framework. For all of us as christian women to say okay god had a plan god had a purpose god isn't holding out on me in singleness god isn't trying to withhold pleasure from me on purpose cuz he wants to punish me or squash me he didn't give me this sex drive and then say it's only for marriage because he hates me like no god designed all of us a sexual beings and then had a plan and purpose so that in marriage it would draw has been in life together it would become a celebration of that company it would become an act that unifies the husband and wife something that brings them together something that can also create children a beautiful gift within marriage family like so many blessings so many gifts so much intentionality but you see when you take sex outside of marriage you rip it out of that covenant you rip it out of that union you rip it out of that place for intimacy for vulnerability for family for all these things that is when so much of the brokenness so much of the confusion so much of the heart so much of the sin the impact that is when it happens and so ask christian women we need to get this framework right that god is a good god a good father and he plans things intentionally on purpose for our good and for our thriving and for his glory and so getting back to this picture and saying god i trust you i believe you help me to understand more about this design and to uphold the beauty of your design that you created. It's interesting because although a lot of our world doesn't acknowledge god his design. Really infiltrates like we are all image bears and we are his creation whether we acknowledge it or not and so i the like a few months ago i was like you know i want to hear like for christian i mean not for christian for secular women women who do not acknowledge god who do not hold to any specific religion or anything. What are the experts in that realm saying about intimacy and and. Who are you know how to find sexual satisfaction so i listen to an insanely popular podcast for women. And it's one of like it's just a very very popular podcast and the reason i chose it is because she had a female sex therapist on and so i was like i just want to hear this conversation and hear what kind of questions non-religious women are asking and what advice this secular sex therapist is giving and what was super fascinating is that one. Secular women are asking very much the same questions that christian women are asking but. The advice that the secular sex therapist gave she was saying that truly the best sex the best intimacy happens when you are in a long-term committed relationships you didn't say marriage but she just said when you're in a long-term committed relationship where you can communicate where you can feel safe where you can feel free to grow into express and i'm like. They you know they're not putting that in the context of marriage they're just saying like you know a safe committed relationship but like whoa where did that come from like why is that where sexual intimacy thrives and grows and women feel free to express themselves and and you know blossom in their sexuality it's because god designed it that way in the beginning like you just said back in genesis god has a good design so as much as we try to pull away from that as a world and kind of like as a society it's amazing that the experts out there apart from pointing to god are saying hey in a committed relationship this is where sex thrives and their their advising secular women saying hey. If you want to be a sexually thriving woman you need to be in a committed relationship i just thought that was crazy yes back to god even if we don't acknowledge him you know. I love when secular theory secular therapist or science completely backs up god's design which happens again and again cuz it just shows like god knew what he was doing he has a plan so this makes the question if sex is designed for marriage there are all sorts of other sexual acts sexuality so maybe moving into this conversation about how one how seriously god takes this because he won one thing that we didn't touch on god takes this very seriously because sex isn't just about the pleasure the covenant of marriage it is actually an earthly representation of god's relationship with his people with his church god gave us marriage. The covenant between a man and a woman and then sexual intimacy to be a reflection it's a metaphor we see this in ephesians 5 of an earthly picture for humans to look at and say. It's a broken picture because of sin but it is it is giving us a glimpse of what god's relationship is like with his church of the husband reflecting christ the groom the wife is with the reflection of christ church the bride and sexual intimacy is a picture of the deep knowing the yada we've talked about that word it means a deep knowing of someone else and that is a word that god uses in scripture to talk about the deep knowing that he wants to have with his children in a relationship it's not sexual at all when it comes to god and us it's a deep knowing an intimacy relationally that god is saying i love you i set my son to die for you he is coming back for the church to redeem things once and for all and marriage is an early representation to constantly remind us of that covenant keeping god that god who says i love you so much i pursued you i am in covenant with my church it is a promise that i will never break that is what marriage is supposed to represent reflecting that covenant they got us with his people and so that is why god takes it so seriously that is why in scripture you might feel like wow god is awfully heavy-handed when it comes to verses about sexual immorality or you know keeping the marriage bed pure or like you know things like that like i'm just you know single is it really that big of a deal if i messed around you know if i act out sexually in my singleness like it's not really hurting anyone well that's because we're missing this bigger picture that it's it's a representation of a covenant of god's relationship to his church and so god is very protective of that it's a very holy thing. It's something that god wants us to get right because it matters so much it actually reflects on the gospel right like it's. If we have a distorted if you have sexuality we're probably going to have a distorted understanding of the gospel because it's all interconnected and so god is not heavy-handed in the sense that he doesn't want us to experience joey he wants us to understand how awesome this covenant is the greater picture that it represents that's why he wants us to uphold it in honor in reverence to uphold it in holiness because of what it reflects that's why versus like hebrews 13:4 say let marriage be held in honor among all and let the marriage bed be undefiled. For god will judge the sexually immoral and adulteress and what god is saying here is it marriage is such an honorable thing because what it represents let the marriage bed be undefiled like there should be no defiling of that covenant of that relationship between that man and that woman and god will judge the sexually immoral and the adulteress because when we're when we commit adultery in marriage it is like we are we're basically. Painting a wrong picture of god's faithfulness and covenant with us right like in adultery just as if we as a church if we strayed and started worshiping idols we rejected the one true god and we started worshiping other false gods that would be committing adultery against god and so god is saying marriage if you come in adultery it's like that same picture of the church turning it back on god rejecting god and so that's why god takes this so seriously because of the greater picture it represents and so i think as we move into talking about this for single women. It's very important that we understand god's call for sexual holiness for purity is because he wants us to uphold and have such a deep reverence for the gospel for who god is and what that marriage and sexual act within marriage actually represents. And in our book sex purity and the longings of a girl's heart which you can get on amazon you can get on our website girl to find.com i highly recommend it that is a book for single or married women to really help you fully understand this beautiful god-given you know picture of sexuality why he created you as a sexual being wrong mindset to get rid of and just really you know really understand it rightly but in sex period in the long ends up a girl's heart we say you can live without sex. But you can't live without basically true intimacy with god and that's the reality think of jesus our savior he came to this world fully god fully man and he was not married he did not have sex which sounds weird to say like when you're talking about jesus. He had a fully male body but he was able to have that intimate relationship with god non-sexual but like that deep all-knowing he came to do the will of his father he was you know. Prayerful and into god what do you want from me you have that deep communal relationship with god and that is a picture of what we all need as humans you know we can be that's why you will see people who great missionaries in the past you know where they were like. They were able to maintain a deep all-knowing relationship with god and still somehow had joy and purpose in those difficult times and the reason is because our deepest soul need as humans is not what hollywood tells us it's not that okay if you can just grab that hunk and have the best sex of your life you're going to be satisfied either a lot of people in hollywood having all sorts of sex and there are a lot of people that are right on satisfied saying just in the world you know they're thinking about our own self you know you can you can be masturbating and doing all the things but why is there such dissatisfaction it's because that is not the deepest longing of our heart yes we are sexual beings and that is a beautiful thing but the the deepest need of our heart is a deep. Raw authentic relationship with christ where we know him and he knows us and we aren't. Thank you for sending your son for me i want to know you i want to do your will and it's crazy that you could live your entire life single you could live your entire life without ever having sex and truly live a purposeful meaningful life and this ties in a little bit to my story i know kristen you shared a little bit of some of your singleness and for me i you know i thought well i can say sex for marriage because i'll probably get married 2021.22 i ended up getting married at 30 and so i had some not you know i know there are people who have been single a lot longer than me but for each of us it's like okay what am i going to do with these extra single years and i will tell you it was hard for a while when your friends are getting married and you're like wow maybe i'm never going to get to experience this gift of intimacy this gift of sex with a man and you know we're like those like please go look up don't have the second return until i can get married you know we all have i know i wasn't the only one like i mean it's going to be great to be having sex can i please get married first you know like. For me it was coming to this place of god like. I know you're a good guy and i know you have a good plan for my life so if you do not have marriage in my future can i live a purposeful like thriving life and i'm going to tell you it took some work it took some. I had to really dig into the word and evaluate my heart and really grow in this area but i came to this point where i was able to. If you do have me single for the rest of my life i can thrive in the season and i'm telling you i know for some of you that's impossible like i do not want that like please don't even speak those words but it is possible and i'm telling you the last few years of my singleness i look back with so much joy and so much like i love those years of my life because i had really entered into this place of saying god i'm here to live for you and i'm going to embrace these single years with the benefits that come with singleness like a lot of schedule flexibility being able to kind of pick up and just go and do what you know a trip or travel or invest in ways into other people that i haven't you can't you know like marriage is different and there are differences that single women can embrace that are harder for married women and so entering into that and saying wow how can i use my life my time my body and ways that are glorifying to you but that are fully thriving in this season and so i just want to encourage you it is possible not in your own strength you have to really really you know. Dig deep into a relationship with christ spending time with him getting mentors really filling your mind with truth and getting discipled by godly women. Being in a community within your church those are the things that are going to really help you in that direction but that's just a word of hope to know that there are single women. In their you know relationship with christ so i just hope that encourages you a little bit. I'm sure a lot of single women who are listening are feeling encouraged by that hopeful. Picture of like wow that is where i want to get but i am guessing a lot of them just like i was for many years are not in that place yet. And they're in that place of struggle they're in that place of even wrestling with like. Well you know masturbation seems like a great way to have a sexual release in my singleness i know marriage isn't anywhere on the horizon soon i see this bigger picture of god's design for sex and marriage it's beautiful i want to run you know i want to have reverence and respect and up hold that pursue that you know but i'm not there yet and i have a very strong strong sex drive and i'm struggling and it's something that i just feel like i can't break free from and so i think this would be a great time to talk specifically to single women who are in that place of struggle and who are even questioning like if it's really a big deal or not like i've heard i've heard this from many single women i even thought this myself for many years like you know i know this isn't the best like i know it's very lustful fantasy driven i don't think what's happening is really honoring to god or his covenant for marriage this like sexual act of masturbation but is it really hurting anyone like is it really that big of a deal just got really care that much and so i just want to speak to women who single women specifically who are in that place because i can relate i remember thinking so many of those same things. And like i said. Earlier i think for me i didn't have that bigger framework i wasn't operating from that bigger framework of what is god's design for sex and i kind of you'd masturbation as like a separate act like you know it's just like you know it's just orgasm like it's really not that big of a deal but it wasn't until i really understood like the holiness of marriage the like the intentionality of marriage how much respect and reverence god had for it and how although masturbation is never mentioned in the bible. I think we could all agree that it is a sexual act i don't really think there's any other category you can drop masturbation in that it would fit other than the fact that it is a sexual act right i mean you are stimulating your genitals as a single person for orgasm and so as we think about this and as we think about this act that we're leaning into although it feels so natural it feels like it's just such a natural expression of our sex drive like i get that 100% we really have to ask these questions not is it in is it not i don't see this word in the bible so it's not a big deal but these are some of the questions that we post in our pdf resource that we created finding freedom from masturbation that just released last week last week. And these are the questions that we should be asking questions i wish i had known to ask earlier in my struggle as a single woman. What is masturbation in line with god's design and purpose for sex and intimacy. I'm like we've talked about sex and intimacy were created for marriage it wasn't a random act that god gave to all people it was a celebration of covenant that god gave for a husband and wife that is where sex was that's where god placed it that was his choice and so as we engage in masturbation stimulating our genitals to orgasm. Is that in line with god's purpose and plan as we see in scripture we have to be really honest about answering this question. Most of the time at least from when i talk to you it's connected to what the mind is doing as well so i think of course like those two together like what is your mind doing from most women we've heard of it's a fantasizing about someone that is not their spouse. Yes yes. Yeah and sadly our society has taken such a hard turn toward embracing all things pornography erotica we are told as women it's completely normal this is absolutely natural to embrace your sex drive in this way to orgasm watching porn reading erotica looking at very sexualized pictures that is all very normalized in our society so it i can understand why it might feel like wow this seems extreme but as christians we have to remember that we are not called to do things according to the world where called to be set apart we're called to pursue christ and his glory and to embrace god's design in his plan and let's remember. Even the world oftentimes comes around to realizing that god's way is the better way even though they don't say it's god's design. They start living in accordance to it because god's design is one of order it's one that helps us thrive and bring him glory whether we even realize it or not his ways are always right always good. I could not masturbate without having some sort of lustful sexual fantasy going on in my mind like 100% true for me and i know as i've talked to women i don't think i've ever met one that's like know i just i read scripture and masturbate and it's great like. I don't really think that's happening you know. So asking these questions is so important is masturbation an authentic expression of sexual pleasure with in marriage and a single women were not even married right so there's no way that we can. That we can masturbate within a marital relationship to even enjoy pleasure with our spouse there's no spouse so there's no intimacy it's just a solo act of pursuing pleasure for ourselves so it cannot be an authentic expression of sexual pleasure within marriage because there's no marriage and then lastly does masturbation help me pursue a heart of purity before god. I know for myself like i said that it was not helping me it was not helping me pursue holiness purity even it wasn't helping me pursue satisfaction in my singleness of. How can i use my energy my body for your good to serve others for your glory and in our pdf guide we break down 8 very practical steps that you can take that personally helped me on my journey to eventually finding freedom and my singleness i did reach a place where i i was able to conquer that sin and i want i hope that's helpful for you in your singleness to think okay it is possible to get to a place where you can have victory it doesn't have to be a forever struggle but it's so important that we get back to the basics of the framework of our understanding of sexual intimacy what honors god what doesn't purity holiness in our mind and then even our bodies and our sex drive and learning how to take all of that pent-up energy that we feel like we're just going to explode like learning how to take that energy and pursue good things for others i know you mentioned bethany and you're single miss as the more you looked outward the more you pour into other serving looked for ways to bless people even for me practical things like exercise. Very helpful like i've got all this pent-up sex drive like okay i don't just have to sit here and cry about it like i can go run you know i can go do like a little weight workout or something to just like exert some energy so just thinking of your body being in tune with your body and i know bethany you've talked a lot about this just on your own instagram account of like a single women understanding our sex drive but understanding god's call and then saying okay i've got all this pent up energy how can i use this to serve others to be aware of what's going on in my body but to exert this energy in a way that's going to be god on ring. Yeah i think that's a huge because we don't want to become at war with our body like god created us with bodies just like i talked about his you know death and resurrection wouldn't have been possible without his body so the body is important the body is valuable i love the work that nancy piercy has done even in her book love thy body we've had her on the podcast. Dr julie slattery she's written a book on sex and the single girl we had her on the podcast we have an episode she also kind of talks about this stuff but it's not be coming at war with your body and saying okay. Because i struggle with masturbation i just want to disassociate from my body and then one day when i get married i just need to turn the switch and say okay now my body is a good thing like don't view your body as the enemy view it as something that beautiful that god gave you that you can use in the right context right now so like kristen mentioned. Exercising can be such a beautiful thing and i would encourage you sometimes. Take off the headphones don't listen to music like exercise and notice what your body is doing like feeling your muscles feeling how you know the sweat feels on your skin stuff like that can really help you to see the beauty and how god created your body and not make it the enemy so when i was single i decided to train for a marathon which was very extreme but it really it was such a great goal and such a great use of my body and i have the time as a single woman to train for that so like kristen mentioned exercise that's a great thing that you can do another great thing god designed us in to enjoy and to appreciate physical contact in non-sexual ways so you know if you're someone who has a really good friends or you come from the big family just so those hugs can release great hormones and it's. In a non-sexual way so making sure that you're in community if you don't have family around where you have that non-sexual physical touch even like volunteering in the nursery at your church something like that where you are able to have or even getting a pet i mean there are literally like ways that you can have that connection to other living beings that is completely non-sexual but really helps you to embrace god's good design for just connection with others and so. Single women that they can end up getting into this place so struggling with masturbation because they just don't have enough going on in their life they don't have enough purpose they don't have enough to think about and so they just kind of end up defaulting at night into masturbation and so making sure that your life has a lot of purpose that you have direction that you have a lot going on in a good way you know like i said getting involved in your church getting involved in singles groups serving i'm making sure that you have a good meaningful job work to do like we were created for all of that and i think the more that you can aim your life towards good things the easier it's going to be to put off those sinful habits and we're not going to be able to get into all the practical strategies in this podcast you can go back and listen to kristen story we'll link up below you can just search on our podcast masturbation we have another episode but then i would really encourage you if you're someone you're saying yes i. And a single woman or a married woman who was struggling with this lust-filled fantasy driven like apart from a covenant you know marriage apart from my spouse. I need some help i need some freedom i definitely recommend grabbing the guy that is for sure for you so we'll link up a little go to girl to find calm slash shop but i do want to have a quick word to the married women we've got two yes well married women fall in such a different camp because you fall within the category of people who are within a covenant relationship where sexual intimacy is it not only encouraged in the bible but it's celebrated its right and good we have an entire book. Call the song of solomon which i know most of us are well aware of where it is a beautiful book highlighting the sexual intimacy between a husband and wife. Painting this incredible picture of intimacy a pleasure of arousal of pursuing. Of all of the body parts like it is a very explicit very beautiful picture of sexual intimacy in marriage and so. Is married women we fall in this camp where sex is a good thing where it is something we can embrace where we can pursue but also because of sin i know that impacts so much of our our sex life even in marriage and there's a lot that we need to work through as husband and wife and different desires struggles things from the past and so i know in marriage is not like it's all just cut and dry black and white like go for it but something that i think that bethany you also talked a lot about is that in marriage i think so often we place a lot of extra boundaries on what would be considered okay or what would even be considered godly within our marital relationship. They're coming from extra biblical teaching like it's not even things that we see in scripture it's just things that maybe we've heard from other christians or we've been raised in a certain line of thinking and so we get older and we feel very trapped almost like okay it's like pretty pretty pretty pretty before marriage and then you get married and it's like anything goes but like is everything really okay i don't know how to navigate this there can be a lot of shame a lot of confusion and so i think it's christian women we need to recognize that we we should not add more. Boundaries then what scripture gives us for our marital relationship that in a marital relationship it should be as we see in scripture that it is a man and a woman in a loving committed covenant marriage both pursuing one another in love and that sexual intimacy should be a beautiful place of exploration of pleasure where the focus of each spouse is to serve one another when selfishness and sin demands manipulation when things like that and the marriage covenant that is not a beautiful expression of sex and i think we just need to acknowledge that there are unbiblical sinful ways to pursue in a marriage to pursue sex that are not in line with god's heart for love for kindness for serving one another for selflessness like those are all like characteristics of love that should also be on full display in our marriage bed it should be this mutual giving and receiving of enjoying pleasure of giving pleasure. With one another and i know what we received a lot of questions a lot of dms bethany from married women who were saying well i'm i don't understand like what about masturbation in marriage specifically so addressing some of the dms that we got and specifically addressing masturbation and marriage is something that we've never fully talked about yes so i think that's where the definition that you mentioned at the beginning it's a little bit. Confusing when you get married because i would say that that definition is a great definition for our single women but when you get married there is you know it's really like a team act you know it's like you are in this together and that's why i love how you said we shouldn't add things to scripture because you know i had a friend who messaged me and said that you know one of her mom's pieces of advice to her before she got married was you can have fun but just make sure you don't have too much fun like somehow having too much fun sexually with your husband is like crossing a line and i'm sure you have heard things and so one of my favorite fancy winslow she runs the podcast heaven in your home highly recommend if you're married but she encouraged us to ask the question. Who told you that and it's basically like if you have a question about something within your marriage like. You know this is specifically for married women so i'm going to be a little bit blunt here if you're single you can kind of like pass over this part we don't want to encourage any further struggle so maybe just skip the next five minutes but for married women it's questions like is oral okay is it okay for me to help stimulate myself while my husband and i are together things like that and in what i see in scripture there is no boundary against those things the scripture is very clear that things like fornication having sex outside of marriage adultery having sex with someone that is not your spouse homosexuality lustful passions horse joking those are the things that scripture is against but when you get into the book of song a solomon you see a groom and a bride going to town you know you just see them having all sorts of fun all sorts of exploration all sorts of positions all sorts of touching things. Body parts everywhere i mean it is just left up to our own imagination interpretation and i think christian couples should be the ones having the most fun being the most creative exploring the most when you think about it if you say within a marriage relationship like okay well you know this hand here this body part here is okay this position missionary is the godly like where the heck are we getting that from you know stop and ask yourself yeah i told you that that's okay or not okay because if we go to scripture you're going to see a lot of that stuff is just pulled out of nowhere that someone told you i heard on. And they just they talked about everything and they've been super helpful in this area and they said within marriage there shouldn't be any secrets so if you are engaging in an act or doing something that does not know about that is a huge red flag so if you and your your spouse have a question like okay i would like to be a part of helping stimulate myself while we're having intimacy because men or women are different and sometimes that can really help is that something that you were doing together that he knows about that he is on board with that you're on board with that's a discussion that you can have that you can be a part of you know there's been a lot of encouragement for christian married women within marriage to make sure they know their body they know what parts are where they know what feels good and that's going to look different for everyone and comfort levels in that way are going to look different for everyone but i think the most important thing is making sure that you and your husband are communicating and you two are coming up and deciding for yourselves what's okay for you to and what's not as long as it's not those things that we i just mentioned to you which comes from a blog post by julie slattery's called what's okay in the bedroom i'll link below so as long as you're not directly going against scripture or bringing pornography and bringing a third person things like that. If you are not lusting after another man as you're having sex stuff like that then it's really god gives a lot of freedom and that's beautiful so instead of resting so much in your marriage like is this okay can i put my hand here can you put his hand here can i do this like. Communicate as a couple be prayerful about it but i would say we need to be. Less putting these extra boundaries on ourselves within marriage then not especially in the christian circle so that's why i have a little bit of an issue with the definition when it comes to the married couple because i think that can. Add. Some stuff that might not actually be prohibited from scripture does that make sense yeah yeah that makes sense and in fact it's interesting you say that because in the dictionary there are two definitions for masturbation one and two and the second one i feel like applies more to marry people cuz it says so the second definition. States that stimulation buy manual or other means exclusive of sexual intercourse of another's genitals especially to orgasm and so in some ways i feel like that could be more in line because masturbation is the stimulation of ones or a genitals to orgasm but it could be your self stimulating them or some other means you may not necessarily be having full-blown intercourse but there is orgasm happening and so like you said. In that place of intimacy between that man and wife there might be moments where it is helpful for you to stimulate for the pleasure of both of you mutually you know men and women are built very different the way we orgasm is very different and so i feel like that could be more helpful where it doesn't mean it just has to be used stimulating it could be or it could be your husband it doesn't necessarily mean that you're having intercourse but the goal is orgasm pleasure so yeah there's a lot of nuance we can't address every single last thing if you're married are greatest encouragement would be for you to have open communication with your husband about all of this to look at god's work together and say is what we're pursuing in line with god's beautiful boundaries for intimacy for purity holiness that allows to marriage is like that's when we're not bringing pornography we're not bringing other things in its holy and pure between the two of us is that what's happening and or are we also adding a lot of extra rules. Boundaries things that are causing a lot of fear within our intimacy that aren't actually found in scripture are we losing our ability to celebrate fully because we're fearful that we might be sending in some way like go to the lord together study learn grow from godly biblically-based gospel-centered resources people who have entire ministries based on this and will link a lot of resources below but our greatest encouragement is that you and your husband need to go to the lord together have open communication continue going to the word learning and growing and then deciding for yourself what is most faithful for the two of you in the bedroom okay you have a final word. A final word because this is we don't have a specific resource with girl defined but this has been such a passion of mine and i have only been married for. 4 years and i just been like i've had so many questions and i have wanted to finally good gospel centered resources to really have like yeah i'm super open and honest conversations like kristen and i have and so i did create a resource it's called the ultimate sex course for christian women and there's 11 sessions whether you're engaged or married this is something that i would really invite you to or be a part of we everything that kristen and i have talked about we take like a 1000 deep dives and learn from incredibly. Godly woman experts who have studied this area who have gone through their own struggles and and have just they have so much to offer so that's actually at my website which is bethany field.com a link up below but if you're married i know i mean kristen's been married for a long time she's like she's more of an expert in these ways i've only been married for 4 years but this is a resource that has been i'm telling you it's been so helpful for me and i just don't want our married women to be like okay where are the resources what where what next. So you can you can grab that and i think that would be super helpful. The frogs are getting me. Because this is only the start of learning and growing i hope that this just. Encourage you inspires you want to say wow there is so much out there for me to learn god does have a good design like i can't wait to dig deeper like i'm excited weather single or married so we'll differentiate those in the below will put on like resources for single women resources for married women so that you can just this can just be the start of the learning and growing and really finding freedom process.
