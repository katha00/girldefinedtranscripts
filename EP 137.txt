Today on the girl to find show we're talking about the fact that so many of us look happy and cheerful and connected on the outside especially on social media but the reality is on the inside so many of us feel lonely disconnected and longing for deep friendships in fact a recent statistics showed that 60% of americans feel lonely on a regular basis and if you think well if i could just you know be more famous or be more well-known or be more connected even online then i would feel happy but i was shocked when i came across a quote by lady gaga where she talks about a time in her life someone who we would look at and say they're so famous they have so much money they have the world at their fingertips and she literally said i'm alone every night and all these people will leave right they will leave and then i'll be alone and i go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day total silence and so if someone is famous as lady gaga and many other celebrities have confessed how. On the inside they feel alone many of us feel that we long for connection how do we find it how do we get there we're going to unpack all of that today on the girl to find show what's up y'all it's bethany and kristen here hey guys. It just honestly breaks my heart to think about how lonely so many of us are especially in this age of like tik tok really where you can get like overnight success you know success and you can gain literally millions of followers and you've seen these stories and it's kind of like it's oddly become almost like the american dream for so many people to become like a celebrity like an influencer a celebrity in so many people want that but the reality is you know you can go out there and you post these videos are you have this you know the funny tik tok whatever it is and then you go home just like lady gaga said a night and you're by yourself and you're like. I feel like anyone really knows me i don't really have any deep intimate relationships and that lack of true in person relationship can be really devastating and so heartbreaking because that's not how god designed us he literally designed us ultimately to be in community with him that deep knowing relationship with him and then in community with one another and so i think that. The positives of social media us being able to connect with you here so a lot of negatives and i just want to say personally like i have felt that even with girl to find you know because we'll have people who will come up to us you're not a restaurant or when we're out walking like oh my goodness i love girl to find like i listen to your podcast and i always tell them i'm like thank you so much for coming up and saying hi because for the majority of the time what we do is literally talking to a camera and we know you're behind this camera right now watching her through the audio listening but we don't get to see your face we don't get to hear your voice and so even this it's like sometimes like wait are they really there are the people like do we really have a relationship so when we get to see you face-to-face we're like oh my goodness you're real you're this real person or i don't even recognize the picture from instagram because you're someone who had commented a lot or whose followed for a while or you're a patron you know something like that so just know like this is a problem and we are going to give. Play some really really practical advice on how to overcome this on how to take steps forward toward building relationships and i know the older you get sometimes it can feel even more intimidating as you become an adult even as you get married have kids you can feel like it gets harder to make deep friendships and we're going to give you some real good practical stuff to take away today so that you can leave feeling like wow i kind of have some steps for making some deep friendships there's someone in the bible who i feel like is a really great example of struggling with loneliness and inner turmoil but then taking it to god not just keeping it all in the inside struggling secretly but crying out to god and that is david and i love this song because he cries out to god he pours his guts out to god in his turmoil in his angst in his loneliness where there were times where he had a long seasons of hiding from his enemies he was alone he didn't have that thriving community he didn't have a thriving life and he would take the cries the tremols of his heart to the lord and we actually created a seven-day devotional. Through the psalms so it's not going through all of the songs but just some of the songs and it's literally if you're watching you can see this picture here psalms a 7 day devotional through the songs and this is something that i hope can be a really big encouragement to you if you're in that stage or that season right now where you feel like i am lonely i desire to connect i think a great first step could be going to a book like songs and getting honest with god about your struggles with about your hearts cry your longings and the songs can be a great launching point and encouragement to your heart and if you want this digital resource we will give it to you for free if you join us our support team over on patreon.com girl define it's a platform where you can support our podcast our videos by giving a dollar or two dollars per episode that we create and our way of saying thank you for supporting us and enabling us to bring this content to you we create free resources digital downloads that come out every month and this devotional through the song is just one of them when you become a patron you will get all of our resources and there are dozens of them that we create every month you'll get all of the past ones plus every single one that we create moving forward these are amazing and if you're like yeah i don't really want to become a patron but i want some of these resources you can just buy that one at a time on our shopping list or sorry our shop is girl defined calm slash shop you can get access to dozens of resources that will help you with very specific things in fact one of them is actually on friendship yes so we recently created a pdf resource that is specifically on this topic a friendship if you're someone who feels like. I need more there's a new resource that just came out a few months ago called friendships how to make friends when you feel left out and forgotten it's a very practical digital resource that will walk you through the specifics of how to actually pursue friendships to help you grow and thrive in community when you feel left out and forgotten so i hope you'll also take advantage of that resource over at girl to find.com i just want to talk about why friendships matter so much there's a moment that's kind of like i think it's seared into both of our minds cuz it's such a beautiful moment when we had the girl to find conference which i know people ask us about that all the time like when are you gonna have to go to find conference which was this amazing annual conference here in texas in our home town of san antonio and we would have this incredible 100 of you would come and we would just talk about all things what it means to be a girl to find by god it was just incredible because we had that in person community and it was amazing and i promise one day it's coming back and so i'm sure she promised just now we want to we really want to but one of the reasons that so many of you actually like put out the money to fly in literally from other countries around the world is not you were desperate for community for that sisterhood to look around and say wow there are other women who are following god there are other women who want to fear the lord their other women who value the gospel who value what god says about men and women and living that out and you just wanted to be around people like that for a few days just for some encouragement because then when you go back to your hometown when you go back to your college is your family sometimes you can feel like. You have the power of the holy spirit which is ultimately the most important thing but it's. And we would reach out and we would hold hands all together and just have a time of praying and asking god to give us strength. To support one another and encourage one another in whatever way we can through the friendships we've made even if it's via text or a facetime or connecting you know online to be there for each other and it was always such a beautiful moment cuz i just remember looking out and seeing all of us linking arms holding hands and it was just like wow. We're not alone and that it was an amazing time but i get it you leave that moment and you go back home and it's hard and if you are not so intentional. To pursue friendship and to find people even just one person local or someone even that you can connect with via facetime it kind of can quickly go back to wow i'm all alone i don't have anyone and so i think it's really important not to live from those highs to highs even though those are such beautiful moments but to really figure out how can i build just even one deep and meaningful relationship with someone in my community with someone nearby because that truly can make a world of difference and we're going to teach you how to do that for you he wants community because he created the body of christ he created the church like christ said go and establish my church and the people in the church will be called the body of christ like you will be believers living out the one another's we were actually made for community not made to do this alone i mean even at him god gave to him like yeah it was not good that he was alone i mean one of the reasons so it is important to remember this is in line with god's heart of what he desires for his children that we would walk in community he wants that for you so to pray that and say god i'm struggling i feel lonely i feel left out i feel forgotten. You know i i want this know that that prayer to desire godly community to desire a sisterhood to have women that you can walk alongside and live out life day in and day out the highs the lows not just the highlight reels on instagram that is what god wants for you and i think it's so easy to short circuit that because it's hard like pursuing relationships pursuing people it's hard it's messy it can feel awkward it can feel uncomfortable it can be like how do i even take the first step you know people aren't reaching out to me what do i do and it is easier. Absolutely to not reach out to not pursue to not get involved in a church and instead scroll on social media or feel like you're connected because you're like well i've got a hundred friends on instagram like you know i should be okay and you can scroll their pictures all day you can follow all of the celebrities and so it gives this false sense of connectedness and i sadly and even after the pandemic i think a lot of us have fallen into that that false sense of connectedness where we feel like we have friendships we feel like we have relationships but a lot of them are digital a lot of them are long distance a lot of them are remote where it's just hard to live out that life on life stuff and so we don't pursue anything because we feel like we have something but then 60% of us statistically we feel alone we feel lonely and we long for more and so it's it's important that we recognize that like am i taking the easy road or am i willing to do the hard work of cultivating and building friendships because i know that's what god wants for me and ultimately living in a body life on life that's actually for my god i mean there's just so many studies of even just human contact and how important that is and just even for loneliness for anxiety for depression how literally being with people seeing someone else or just like looking into it true that someone saying your name physical touch just even the you know hormone release that can happen with all of that is so crucial to human thriving just like from the way god made us so if you look into kind of like i guess i'll see you behind it there there's so much proof even from a secular standpoint that this is so beneficial and so healthy forest and i think that's why and so many ways the pandemic was so detrimental and so many people's lives because we were alone and we were isolated from other people we weren't hearing people say our name we weren't seeing that face-to-face contact when we weren't having that physical touch and so it's crucial and when you have deep friendships you get this on a regular basis on something interesting that lady gaga quote that i read the very beginning i find so fascinating because she had a lot of what you're saying right she had a lot of face-to-face she had people touching her all day or her concerts like wow you know so it's it's not even just that which that is a huge part of it it's also that those the relationships they're not just there like they're not yet he totally your life but they're actually intimate relationships because you know like i said she's someone who has everything the world says that we would need to be happy and you know like oh you will be so happy if you could just reach this pinnacle this fame like you were saying like the tiktok celebrities it's like that's the new american dream is pursuing this sort of thing but that's not even the answer because you can have a million people in your life literally screaming and cheering your name and yelling and saying how much they love you and yet she would go home at the end of the day she would lie about it at night and she would realize i'm alone and quiet i don't have that person i don't have an intimate relationship of someone who actually knows me where i can be known or i can know them and so therefore she was struggling with homelessness so totally it's so important that we recognize like it's not just being around people i know a lot of us can get into that mindset where we just show up at church yes and then we leave we sit in the back we slip in late and then we're like oh that's kind of hard to talk to people kind of awkward so we leave early we don't make efforts and we're like what's wrong i'm going to church i'm around people people know who i am but yet i still feel so lonely and that's because we're not making the efforts to cultivate intimate relationships and i actually went through this recently my husband and i. There was probably going to come a point where we wanted to transition to a smaller church and just something where we could be more like a more like you're describing like a more intimate relationships and you know loved my previous church it was just a much larger church and so we knew that but i kept putting it off because i'm like this is hard like i hate the idea of trying to find a church and to build new relationships it's always difficult and i remember if you were visiting different churches to really you know be a church where we could serve but also like receiving all of that and you go in and you literally know nobody and you can be surrounded by people and literally feel lonely like i don't know anyone knows my name no one knows and you know it's hard so i got that i was just there less than a year ago and if you're not place where you're like yeah i am part of a pretty big church but i don't know anyone and i feel like i've tried to make efforts it might be time to look into some smaller church as i know there are a couple places like the gospel coalition of a church finder is that no no no. Rooted in the word committed to the gospel not adding not just light and fluffy you don't feel good the gospel coalition does have a church directions but it's like that like you could be a part of a church that is kind of like a show up leave kind of feeling like it's more of a show like you're more of a viewer less of a participant and so i think it's really important to make those efforts to get uncomfortable to get yourself involved in a church that really does have the opportunity for you to serve to get involved but also to receive to be a part of community to open up to have those intimate relationships and so after you know a few weeks i can't even remember i might have been months i don't remember how long it was we. But it was absolutely amazing such incredible teaching from the word the community you could just like it was like family and with people we had never known and we were really intentional to get involved from the beginning to get our kids involved to show up to the different you know studies and and breakfast and and dinners and things that were happening and put ourselves in that position of feeling like okay i don't really know anyone we're going to dinner with these people or having these people over we had to go through that uncomfortable season of like i don't know you but i want to get to know you and it's amazing even though it's only been like eight months that we've been there and i had my husband talk all the time about how incredible this community is and how were there for one another we support one another when we're going through hard times are celebrating when great things happen and we haven't even all known each other all that long but it's amazing what the body of christ can become when you are in a church like that and i know there are just like that all over kristen goes to an amazing church there are many more and her own city and all over the world and so it just takes some time. That's probably one of the best ways that you can go about being a part of the body of christ building community is finding that local body of believers and it's hard it can take time it can take work but i encourage you go to 9 marks dot org the number nine and then marks m a r k s dot visiting some churches in your local area to help you kind of get the ball rolling with that yeah and i was going to say if you're international i don't know if that will work it might but you might have to make extra extra extra effort i know is i've talked to some sisters around the world they live in areas where it is really genuinely difficult to find a church period or a gospel center church so you know if there's a season where you're like there is literally nothing in my area then tune in to a church that's online like a gospel center church like find other believers in your community maybe gather together on sunday and watch the sermon together discuss it like. Think outside the box if you're like i literally don't have anything i live in this country where we barely have churches you know in general you know that's just not we don't have the resources like you might have in your country then i encourage you to really think outside the box of how can you lead and enabling yourself and other believers in your community. Did you get involved as a body to become the body together in your community to live out the one another's but something i did want to touch on is this whole idea that in scripture we talked about the one another's but there are actually. Many verses that call us to walk in the one another's and this is god's way of saying you are a body you are a unit you are you are my children a family i mean we're called a family like that's what a body is and we all have different roles different giftings different ways of serving but we're meant and designed by god to do it together for our good for the flourishing of one another for the pursuit of sharing the gospel for ministering for the confession of sin and i just want to read through some of the one another's and you can look him up just the one another's of scripture just to get an idea of what god wants for his children what he wants for you what he desires you to have as your living life in a church and building relationships that satisfy that desire for relational connection it is a real thing you do not have to stay lonely you can pursue genuine relationship so love one another that's one of the most common one of the greatest commandments right is to love one another how can you love people if you're not in a community to do that if you're not in a church where you can love others and pour out how can you do that you can't even live out that first thing so love one another and another one of the other one another we see is on one another in the church greet one another we see welcome one another show hospitality to one another have fellowship with one another. Agree with one another so working to make peace or working through things i'm living harmony with one another be at peace with one another be kind to one another forgive one another. Bear with one another and it goes on and on comfort care for confessions pray for one another these are all things found in scripture where god is saying this is what the church is to look like living out these one another and it cannot happen if you're just a in the door out the door kind of christian you're disconnected you have to make the choice and as you pursue that and you pursue these one another's you ask god to grow you in these areas i think you will be amazed at the flourishing and the relationships that you experience and how satisfying that is i really want to get nitty-gritty here so i want to give some practicals because i know we've we've covered a lot of the meaning and we're not going to take a deep dive on that but we do have the guide on the friendship guide that you can get in our shop so girl to find calm slash shop and you go toward digital products or digital resources we have i think we have two different friendship guys we have the friendship one how to make friends when you feel left out and forgotten and then we have another guy that's all sorts of questions and things that you can ask practically with some of this because you guys i'm the person where my brain freezes and i have no idea so we have a guide 50 questions to deepen your friendship so that you can take some of the friendships you have and actually turn them into deep into intimate real meaningful friendship so go to girl to find calm slash shop go to our resources section go to the digital resources and you'll find all those there but i just want to see each to share just like. A few things that we have done especially as we become adults to really cultivate adult deep friendship because that's one of the things i've seen especially on social media it's been like how do you do this i feel like there's so many people have said especially women are like i feel like it's hard to make friends as you become an adult like it seems easy when you're like in high school and you're like all at school together or you play the same sport and you're just like forced to be together and you don't have that thing in common like how do you make projects so one of the things that i've done and you can just whatever share your ideas one of the things that i have done is i have. Very very intentionally planned other outings with moms so instead of waiting to be invited for other moms to invite me and say like hey. But i really didn't want to wait for that to happen especially when we were kind of like before we went to this church so i would just like okay who are all the moms that i. They're like someone of an acquaintance i kind of know them and there were some people that i didn't even really know but we were connected on social media and i knew they lived in the area and i would just literally pick a part and say hey we're going to go play out this park from like 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. would love to have you there and you know it was kind of awkward and uncomfortable sometimes because i'm like i don't know who's going to come i don't know if anyone's going to come and i don't even know these people that well but it always turned out to be such an amazing time because they were craving friendship and relationship just as much as me and honestly it took time but there have been some amazing women who i've gotten to know more and more because we've intentionally kind of pursued those friendships after kind of hanging out at the park so you kind of just have to put yourself out there sometimes. Play something invite the people you know like you kind of have to be the initiator and i know that's terrifying and hard but sometimes you just got to put yourself out there yes for sure there are many friendships that i know like they probably they probably wouldn't have these friends if it wasn't for intentionally pursuing and i'm thankful that i have friends that also pursue me but oftentimes i know i can fall into this mindset of like why isn't anyone reaching out to me you know why isn't anyone inviting me over or inviting me out to this activity or inviting me to that gathering like why is noah why aren't people reaching out to me and forgetting wait a minute. I can do the very thing i'm wishing people would do for me which is take initiative take the first step like you said invite someone to do the thing that i'm interested in you know i know some of you might hear the park and go like lots of people that's intimidating maybe you're more of a one-on-one person something that i have found to be extremely helpful in cultivating relationships is to invite one woman out to coffee you know someone that maybe i've met at church we've had like little conversations here and there we don't really know each other super well but i can tell like oh this could be a great friendship to say like hey you want to grab coffee sometime and i have spent many hours over the years in coffee shops you know like an hour here our there hanging out with different women oftentimes it's just one at a time sometimes it might be like two of us if i feel like okay they kind of know each other i kind of know them this could be fun the three of us could get together and have coffee but it's amazing how much deeper the conversations can go how you feel like i kind of know this person to wow i really know this person and not all my feeling intimidating because you're like wait it's just me and i have to maintain conversation what if it's awkward what if they don't really ask questions i get that that can be hard which is why again we have that guy on our shop girl to find calm slash shop 50 questions to deepen your friendships you guys these questions are straight up awesome it's like if you even memorize like maybe 10 of the questions on the list or you got the pdf you downloaded it and right before you go in for coffee you're kind of reading through it like okay oh yeah i have never asked them this or basically 45 out of the 50 i don't even know the answer to will guess what that is a great place to start you're not interrogating them and it's coffee date you're just genuinely trying to get to know them better because as you get to know their life story their struggles what they're interested in their eyes they're lows their pursuits it will deep in your friendship and then will ask the same of you and you'll have this two-way street and that's just the first coffee date then you do another and it's amazing how you can cultivate deep friendships by just initiating starting with a coffee game and sometimes an even less intimidating way is to find. A bible study a book study something like that so for all ages there's an organization bible study fellowship bss it's literally all over the world to all countries it's absolutely everywhere and there are specific women studies and then men studies so you can literally just look on the bible study fellowship website so just literally google bible study fellowship and they have these incredible like really deep bible studies that you can do and you can sign up for and then you're placed in a group and for that entire semester you're with the same group of women so it could be anywhere from like you know 8 to 15 women that are in your maybe even smaller or bigger depending where you live but they're really these small groups and then you go into like the large group setting but that just gives you the opportunity to connect on something that you both have in common jesus and then you have time like you don't have to really put yourself out there a lot because you're both there for the same reason like that so that's a really unintimidating way to build friendships i did that for several years before i got married and it was super helpful and i made some awesome friendships and i also learned a tan so that's a great way to build friendships is to join something like that i would really really encourage you to look into that if you're like one i don't think there's a like i don't know where to get started i don't even have a local church or i don't have a group at all a community at all honestly just look up bible study fellowship and i think that could be a great person i know what that we're running out of town here last thing is if you are able i think ideally if you could find a church that is gospel centered that does have community where you're able to meet in groups with the believers that you're living life within your church that is awesome and for me the church that we're going to my husband and i are family that were going to right now we're in a small group where we meet pretty much three out of the four weeks every month and it is life on life we are digging into things we're discussing the sermon application we divided into guys and girls and have deep heart conversations praying for one another we're walking with each other on a weekly basis and then occasionally we'll get together outside of our small group time for coffee or activities with all the families we see each other on sundays but we know what's going on in each other's life. Every week on a consistent basis so if someone is facing a joy we all celebrate together if someone's facing a challenge we pray for them we come alongside we support and practical ways it is been life-changing for me in this small group and so i encourage you if you're able to get involved in a church in your area that has small groups that's gospel-centered that is an incredible way to connect with people and really live out the one another that we see in scripture you guys there's so much more we could say on this which is why we created that guy to help you take practical steps to know like what are some other ways how can i cultivate friendships i am feeling left out i am feeling forgotten then grab the guide on our website the digital resource just titled friendships and i think that will be really practically helpful to just to help you know like how can i take next steps and it even has some accountability in there like write the name of the person that you're going to initiate and yes it helps you really take action i think you'll find it really encouraging guys thank you for joining us for this conversation come speaking of hanging out come hang out with us over on instagram define ask questions we would love to continue chatting with you about this topic.
