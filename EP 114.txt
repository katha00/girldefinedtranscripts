We are talking about. Is for the way you look at me okay it is the season of love and it's always brings with it a million different emotions. Whether you are single or married i always thought valentine's day like would be the most magical the most amazing ones i got married and me being kind of the i don't know where i am i guess i started to put so many expectations on this day like now that i am married or not that you know i made a relationship this must be the day and then you can't even enjoy it because you have so many expectations on the day so this is going to be a really fun episode we're going to share all about some high some lows from our dating from our marriage so whether you are single or married get ready to laugh and cry and just know that you're not alone on this day of love however it is that you are feeling hey everybody i'm kristen and i am so glad you're joining us for this valentine's special because we love talking about all things womanhood and that includes a married woman stuff single women stuff we are all about biblical womanhood which is something every single one of us can learn about and growing because we're all women about the freedom and beauty that song with in god's design and we thought it would be really fun to do a super down to earth like a girl chat hang out like pretend like we're all just sit and yummy coffee hanging out and having a really hilarious and someone meeting for conversation as we talked about i only have one. I don't even know if i want to get married or you're single and you're like i wish i had a ring on that finger we have a resource that we wrote specifically for you and the coolest thing i love about this book love to find embracing god's vision for lasting love and satisfying relationships is that when we wrote it bethany was 100% single i was in the desert land not even know if she would ever get married but you had come to a place at this point in time when we wrote this book we were thriving in your single miss you still desired marriage it wasn't that you didn't want it but you were thriving in god's season for you his timing for you and i was married when we wrote this book and so sharing from kind of a mary's perspective you know we think it's all going to be perfect on the other side of the aisle but like the real struggles the choice the challenge is kind of my journey in my relationship with the altar what that looked like on that whole dating journey so this is a book for all of our not yet married sisters i think you will find it so incredibly encouraging you'll have some really good laughs maybe a few small cries and a ton of encouragement in our book love to find the married people are. Do you like what's it what's the definition for me. 150 questions to strengthen your marriage and i created this as a resource now as a married woman cuz i did get married to help create those conversations and to help grow closer to one another because sometimes you get past dating and then you get married and you're like you know like you see those couples that dinner like on their phone because they're like we have nothing else to talk about so that's why because it's actually it's. That's awesome ok google she just came out with a new edition i had read her original like a book years ago when she first came out with it so long ago and i had been were friends with her and i remember telling her a long time ago please update it it's so good and it's like kind of outdated the cover and i just don't think people know how good it is and then i was so excited when i saw her email you know a year ago or whatever saying that she was coming out with a new edition and it's beautiful you can find it everywhere finding the hero in your husband i'm currently reading it right now and it's a great one it's just like kind of a different twist on like our perspective as wives in the marriage and how we can influence our husbands and encourage them in ways maybe we haven't thought of yes so there you go oh also i have some other resources here in my hand if you're watching these if you're listening i'm holding something called the christian girls break up survival guide and i hate to bring a broken heart there's a broken heart on this picture here but the truth is i've been through break up you've been through some really hard breakups i know a lot of you have and the way we go through a really hard break up can often determine how we come out on the other side how we view relationships from that point forward how we trust people how we navigate you know even when we get married it can build some bad habits if we don't navigate it properly so this survival guide will be a really big encouragement to you and it's actually a free resource that you can get when you become a patron over on patreon.com girl to find what is that you've already talked about it basically it is that if you like lattice if you like coffee if you like tea and you're like yes i spend four to five bucks a month on that maybe more but i could spare one coffee or one tea that's what you're doing you're supporting us with four or five dollars a month on patreon.com to help us make these kind of shows this content to bring it into the world so you can be encouraged by it and as our way of saying thanks every month we create new instant downloadable resources and this is just one of them the christian girls break up survival guide all so 136 questions to ask in a relationship so this is before you're married to ask in a dating relationship maybe you're engaged you're like yeah there's a lot of questions we have been gone through these are. Okay so this is going to be a fun episode and really personal and it's just going to be like i don't know hilarious and we all just need that around valentine's day we just need to cry. Bring it down a notch bring it down a notch each other these questions and i want to know if you relate to any of these or you can answer these yourself so if you are listening on like spotify or apple head on over to our instagram page at girl define and leave you alone please i want to hear what you have to say ok google. Bum bum bum bum what is your worst valentine's day memory as a single woman no we have to go to the worst one i mean i'll be honest like they were all pretty bad for me i didn't have a great perspective early on so i got married at 24 so 23 valentine's. No. I don't even know maybe. Okay but the one that just popped into my head that i don't know there's probably worse ones but this was just like an awkward one so i was working at this bookstore at the time. And there was this guy that i was not interested in but a friend of mine was extremely interested in him. Here he comes in on valentine's day carrying a huge batch of roses and he red roses he comes in the front and everyone's like all the girls in the back like oh look who came in you know but we don't know why he's there no one knows and i just happened to be in the front at that time and my friend who really was crushing on him was in the back. And so she's you know excited thinking maybe it's for her and i don't you know i'm not knowing anything and then he comes up to me and then gives me the roses and tells me that he just wanted to wish me a happy valentine's day you know he doesn't really ask me out at that point it's just like you know kind of the smile and like here you go and i just remember him walking out no i know my friend was in the back i knew she saw what happened and i'm holding this these roses like. Am i going to do i have like 10 seconds to come up with some sort of response or you know you know it's just so awkward it's just the worst and so yeah there was a bit of a. Confrontation between the two of us my friend and i because she was so disappointed and was kind of like what but i'm like i'm sorry i didn't ask for this i don't want this you can have them you know it was just a terrible thing a terrible thing and i was really glad when that day was okay that is the worst when you and a friend like. I think i had one where i was actually in a relationship and that's weird relationship started and we got like started dating and got married all within a year so we had one valentine's day where we were dating and then the next one we were married so i i remember many many many many many just for people who don't know so i think it i think as much as i was excited and joyful and content the older i got the worst it would kind of like you would really have to work hard to have that joy and that excitement because on that day more and more of your friends are now celebrating with their boyfriends or with their husbands and you start to feel kind of like a kid like oh all of these they're like the grown women and they have their man and i'm over here like what am i gonna do like in the big leagues and you're in the middle east and some of you so yes i totally related to those of you who feel that way like i don't want to be at the kids table anymore i don't want to be the kid on valentine's day i just want to be like a grown woman and with someone so my heart goes out to you and that's probably my worst experience is looking back here after a year after year starting to add them up going in it like i thought that would be something would be different by now okay was there a best. Valentine's day like was there ever won as a single woman where you were like. Okay that was actually pretty fun okay so this is going to be the most hilarious thing ever i actually posted this on my instagram i have to reshare this somehow so y'all can see okay so it was when i had a huge crush on my husband dave this was the so it was the febuary of the year we started dating but we didn't start dating until october so imagine several months before yeah and i don't i think he like. Lie to me about is nothing was going to happen for a while i really liked him and so he and a couple this is the most awkward story she can't even get it out i don't know we started hosting an incredible valentine's day party each year and once you got married you weren't allowed to come anymore so it was only for people that were single or dating and so i am in charge of like leading all the games and like making this an incredibly fun and we were just trying to make it super hilarious and awkward and it really was a highlight of valentine's day because i had something so fun to look forward to knowing about me and all these other people who aren't married we're going to get together and play a bunch of games and just have an amazing time eat lots of food and it's okay wait for all of you who are single feeling like it's the worst day ever here you go plan a party and so i am standing up front like introducing like oh i'm bethany and this is our house and you know here's all the games we're going to play cuz people would invite people it was a huge crowd there were you know maybe be like 60 to 80 people there for the singles valentine's day party at you know my family's house and so i'm standing up front like getting ready to like lead all the games and i've got like all my valentine's day festivities on and then out of nowhere one of the guys from the group comes up to me and interrupts like nothing. A rose for you on valentine's day and i'm like mortified like. Like. What is happening how did i not know who played on this and then so then another one of my really good guy friends he comes at the very end with a huge bouquet of red roses and i'm like okay this has to be it and there are people in my house so this is the first time i'm like. Because you told everyone at the party so it was like your time i make them pay backward. Yes yes okay the only thing that's coming to mine it's like so simple but i remember one valentine's day for a couple i don't know if you were there like a couple just girlfriends we all got together we were all single and instead of just like kind of sitting around or like i don't know just being sad we got super dressed up and went out to dinner and went to like a fancy restaurant and did like a whole you know it's like all the couples everywhere and it's like where the group of single girls but we didn't care and it was just super fun night like a super fancy dinner we got dressed up our hair and just like how does super great girls night. What would be your best advice for halloween day as a single. I'm left out like this isn't for me because i don't have that romantic person but the truth is like you could view it less of like a romantic love and more of like you know god is love like how can i have fun today and show love you know just sisterly love to others and i think planning something and hosting it even if you small friends or going out to dinner or just something simple watching a movie or something big like hosting a valentine's party with all your friends you know all the singles in your community i think just viewing it less of like if you have an attitude of who's going to love me like like soaking in the fact that god loves you more than any man ever could i know that feels cheesy when you're like but i just want the man it's like truly you are more loved by your creator than any man will ever love you and you could use it as a day to celebrate that incredible love that god loves you with and then use that as a reminder to love others knowing others might feel lonely others might feel left out forgotten same thing you might be feeling invite them in take that step be a host be a leader and i think you'll find that as you pour out you'll gain so much more than just sitting and looking with him i mean there's nothing worse than just like sitting around and hoping something happens and like nothing happens like plants on ya do something yes you can be proactive what about you i mean you had so many years of being really intentional yeah they like of course it was just discouraging as the years went on and i'm like well let's go be my future forever you know but really trying to thrive so hosting the singles party was an amazing way to have something to work on to look forward to like i said there was. From year to year anywhere from 6 to 100 people and it was always such a fun time and there are actually multiple couples who met at the singles party and ended up getting married so my advice would be like don't exactly similar to you don't sit around and wait for someone to come and like invite you to something like be the one go after the day that you want you know like you're really funny plan a spa day with some friends playing like a really fun activity even if it's just you and one other friend plan something to wear your mind isn't just like. Great here i am at home and everyone else is having fun and i'm miserable poor me like yes that is the worst you know so plan something really fun and i encourage you if you can be with someone else like a friend or a group of friends definitely make that happen don't wait for the invite be the one to initiate and make it happen i just think that makes valentine's day so much more fun and a fun idea something that you could do because i know you going to the stores and you're like okay there's just like valentine's day stuff everywhere i don't think that we love to do around holidays is they call it like the ding dong ditch you know where you get some like you know teddy bears with like candy or whatever and then you pick a few really good friends and you drive to their house and then you run and leave it on the patio and you knock really loud and then you run away and try to drive away before they can see you and then it's a mystery like who left this there you know i love that and then you can reveal that you were the secret admirer or friend or whoever whenever you want but that's really fun yeah and you don't have to go in this world you can be like hey like i can use this stuff i can do fun stuff with this that's so good okay we're going to transition to a married women and if you're single don't tune out because they're still might be some ideas for you for your future and you might still find this interesting so don't you know let's start with you let's start okay so we want to ask hey you're going to start with me our worst. Valentine's day memory as a married woman okay we want you to share though if you are married i know it's kind of but it's kind of like sad but you got to be able to laugh about it don't share something that's still. I think it was our first or second and you know i am so excited it's like the man like my man and his valentine's i have all these expectations right like all these romantic ideas and like what is he. And i remember just having so many expectations and i think that can be really dangerous your first valentine's i've talked to so many married women who are like their first one didn't turn out anything like they expected because we just can have these big expectations so i had you expect and i'm imagining the super romantic night with reservations at our favorite restaurant all the stuff. And my husband who was really. Pastor and heart of christ wanted to serve others. To serve others and pour out to the community on valentine's because in his thought process he was like wow you know we're newly married this is like one of our first valentine's what better way to walk in the love of christ than to serve others and pour out such a good man such a great heart my heart was not in that place of serving others my heart was like i'm going to have a romantic night with my man end of story and so he comes you know to me like ok. I did not have a good attitude. And he said you know i thought that we could go to downtown and you're not thinking restaurant downtown and he's like and we could look for homeless people and we could go talk to them and share the gospel with them. Staring at him thinking. This is so. Like i didn't even know how to process it cuz it was the so opposite of what i was imagining the night was going to be and so i just kind of like oh let's do it and so we did it and we went downtown and it was just. Awkward and hard and cold and then at the end you know he's like so should we grab dinner and i'm thinking. You didn't even get reservations every restaurant is literally packed and we have no reservations so then we spent the next hour trying to find a place that we could even get into and so anyways we laugh about it now and we it's like it really hilarious now but on that day it was not hilarious and it was not funny and it was probably my worst valentine's because i had such big expectations in my heart was not in a great place and the ladies are like i'm just playing. Funny and it just shows the need for. We got married in october so. How many ounces are our first valentine's day we didn't know about like how you have to make reservations like a million years in advance and so we ended up at this really random restaurant and dave just like regrets it always you always talk about it really wasn't that bad bad bad bad bad for him he just like is he okay. When you're newly married last year or two or three you kind of feel like it's the worst and this has to do with you. What i have only been married for 4 years and i don't even know how many valentine's days i've had but two of those valentine's days we've ended up at the same time at the same restaurant with kristen and zack has happened twice twice. The first was bliss. I am so sorry for the first one but it was hilarious because the first one at bliss we had no both of us we had no idea that our husbands or no husband is not whoever made reservations for the same reason no at the same time that we were like getting dressed up for these romantic and there's no changing it then yes okay so the second one is hilarious because the second time it happened it was valentine's day yeah the only reservations. How many years ago two and a half years ago whenever i don't know 3 years ago whatever happened i can't remember it was the one valentine's day where we didn't eat dinner with you i was. 9 months pregnant i went to the super nice steakhouse restaurant we got this most delicious amazing dinner it was such a special time and then we actually went to the grocery store to get our favorite ice cream afterwards to take back and we're going to have the super romantic evening together and his amazing. And as soon as we pulled up to our apartment i went into full on labor and had like intense contractions and 7 hours later my son david junior was born so that's a really amazing memory because he was out loud he was born on the 15th but i went into labor literally the moment we pulled up and we didn't even eat the ice cream i was like yeah i'm not in the mood for ice cream at that point i don't have like a specific one that's standing out to me but what i love the most is what we've done pretty much every year and it's just like we get reservations way in advance now and zack will routinely like to have flowers delivered to the restaurant ahead of time and then show up at the table and there's beautiful roses and this this is like the sweetest just happened last year and like many years and it's just like i don't know so special and different and it's just the two of us and now that we have our two boys it's even more special like this past year it's just like it's so different because now it's not just the two of us like always the two of us we're having like this special moment this is date night you know someone's watching the kids and it's just the two of us going out i just love that like the simple beautiful dinner obviously romantic flowers on the table and then you know maybe grab some ice cream afterwards like that's kind of our go to routine and it's just sweet and i love it and when you don't get to do the dates is yes you do when you have kids they are not as easy anymore so it's really special it's like a date night so special okay we want to hear from you single or married we want to know your answers to those questions like if you're single worst and best moment you know valentine's day as a single and then married where's valentine's day best valentine's day you can leave all of those comments on our instagram at girl the fight we want i want to hear from you lyrics and hilarious and fun memories so we want to hear from you hope you have an amazing valentine's day and week of love.
