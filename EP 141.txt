What's up y'all welcome back to session number 5 and this one is extra special because a lot of you have probably seen kristen and i together on world of find and we do our podcast together and our videos together but you've probably never seen me interview her and so this is really exciting because i was thinking like who could i bring on to talk about this super heavy topic like single women who are struggling with porn erotica masturbation like it's a big topic and kristen has been super open with her own journey and also we've written a book together on this topic and she has kind of become an expert in this area of helping people find freedom so kristen welcome to the singles course. Oh thanks for having me i know i was just telling you off camera it's a little weird being interviewed by you when we were the ones interviewing and we're having conversations together so hopefully i can bring it. It's going to be amazing though because these single women who are here they have been so brave to join this course because a lot of people have been like why are you doing a course on sexuality and intimacy for single women and they've shown up and been like hey we're sexual beings like we have struggles if like older christian women or christians aren't going to help us like what are we supposed to do turn to google like that's not a great solution and i know we've felt that in our own ministry girl to find and that's one of the reasons we wrote sex purity in the longings of a girl's heart so girls if you haven't got that book you know i've recommended it you need to grab it yes let's read really quick kristen before we get into kind of like your you know mid-teen years rewind and take us back to growing up what was what were your thoughts on sexuality did you have what was like your upbringing like with that i kind of want everyone to set the stage before they get into more of their story. Yeah so like you grew up in a christian family with parents who love jesus they were first generation christian so they were still learning so much themselves of like how to raise christian children discipleship all of that was brand new and i remember from a really young age having questions about my sexuality i don't think i really knew i was having questions about my sexuality it's just you know you're a kid you're curious you you know you have parts you see boys and you know they have different parts and you're like what is all this mean how does all this work together you hear you know. The hush hush word sex every now and then mentioned are you still on a magazine and you're kind of like what is that it's like this big thing but you don't really know and so in our family i would say that our parents were very well intentioned they loved us they they were intentional in many ways to disciple us but i think for that generation in general there was just a little bit of one they were not discipled yeah and god's design for sexuality it was very much a hush-hush. Conversation and they're growing up life and so they for so many of that generation kind of took that into their own parenting and it was a little bit of a hush-hush for them toward their children so i think growing up i know you feel similarly it wasn't really an open conversation it wasn't something talked about regularly so i felt a little bit like i had a lot of questions and i wasn't really sure where to go for answers google didn't really exist yet i don't think smartphones tablet so it was just kind of like this big mystery and you know looking back i just wish so bad that i had had more answers but. I didn't and as i say some of my struggles which i know we're going to get into with less and masturbation i didn't understand what was going on and i just felt a lot of shame and i didn't know how to find answers or how to find freedom and i know a lot of our girls on here have shared similar stories and that's why i'm so excited for them because i was telling them you know i wish i would have had a lot of this teaching like before marriage and i know i did buy you doing a lot of research into sex security longings but having a community an open community like this like when you're still single like the earlier on you can get this kind of teaching and these sorts of conversations the better so i've been telling them like hey you could be a part of like changing the way this has talked about amongst christian women and i keep telling them like if god has marriage in your future working on this stuff and gaining a biblical perspective and finding freedom now is going to serve yourself your future self and your marriage so much because a lot of women just want to shove it under the rug or they don't want to deal with it and then sometimes it does come up in the future and they are married and we've heard stories daniel to story she had a different sexual experience when she was younger but she was so shamed of them that she literally got married never told her husband it wasn't well into marriage that she even opened up about that and she shares how difficult that was and so this is an opportunity for you girls just to think like wow. I am being given an opportunity to open up to have humility to really find a redemption and freedom in christ so that's what this is all about this isn't about going like oh you terrible how dare you like know this is an opportunity to find freedom in the gospel so that's why we're talking about this so fast forward a little bit kristen and share with us like the next part of your story. Figuring things out and going oh wow this feels really good so masturbation became a habitual habit for me and at the time i honestly was so naive i didn't even know it was something sexual like i had no idea what it was and i just had no contacts for it i just thought wow this is interesting this feels really good i thought maybe i had discovered something that the world didn't really know about and so as i got older i started you know reading books some books on just biblical womanhood biblical sexuality and started getting glimpses of like wait a minute this is actually a thing and it has a name and i've been struggling and oh other people struggle oh this is like something people talk about like i had no idea it honestly blew my socks off and so my struggle persisted though and i was just so ashamed for me my struggle with masturbation was very much lust fueled fantasy driven my heart was just fueled with a lot of impure thoughts imaginations you know things maybe i had seen glimpses and i would just kind of extrapolate on those in my mind and so it was definitely not a pure act that i was engaging in and so for me there was just a lot of shame in that in realizing like wow i'm have less than my heart and i confessed to god but then i can continue to struggle and i was tuition to tell anyone i didn't even know who to tell and so i just felt trapped i felt alone i felt confused about my sexuality about these feelings my sex drive all of that so. I didn't know what to do and and it wasn't until a little bit later that i finally found freedom so i don't know if you want me to go into that yet but i think for so many yeah for so many women listening i know you can relate to this struggle of feeling like you're on an island and the longer you struggle with something and you don't bring it into the light like for me the harder and harder it is to do right because then it's like oh my goodness i've been struggling with this for years how can i tell anyone what are they going to think of me how do i even bring this up it just feels so awkward it feels so weird and so i remember the turning point for me happened though when i was attending a christian conference and i remember the speaker was talking specifically about sexual struggles for young people and how you know it's just very common and they were saying you don't have to be ashamed you can open up you can talk about this please don't keep this a secret if you're struggling and they said you know if you have parents that love god that you trust that you can go to that would be a great first step is just to say hey i'm struggling would you pray for me would you help me would you hold me accountable whatever and so i remember leaving that conference and just thinking like i never like i couldn't even imagine what it would be like to go tell my parents just because it was such a weight it was just like i said so much shame so much embarrassment and it took me a while to even. Get the courage to go and tell them and i remember praying day after day just like. Victory is confessing this bringing it into the like getting help getting accountability but i was just terrified and so i remember one day i just decided i was like lorde. Give me the strength because i don't want to do this like i really don't but i know it's going to help me and so i didn't scared and i know that something that we say a lot when we don't want to do something when we're so fearful the enemy wants to keep us tracked and trapped in privacy and secrecy he wants us to feel like we're on an island surrounded by the ocean that there's no way out there's no life but there's no way we could get help but that's just not true we have to take some time scary steps of confession in order to break the silence break the darkness and then get on a path toward freedom and so that was 100% true for me and i remember going to our parents you know you were probably at the house somewhere i don't know where but i remember going to their bedroom door and just knocking and like oh like breathing so heavily and then you know just saying hey can i share something with you can i talk to you and they were like absolutely come in and i remember just sitting on their bed and i couldn't even get the words out. I just started crying and they were so compassionate and so loving and just like you know tell us what's on your heart we want to hear and so i definitely felt like it was a safe place to do that and i just remember sharing and you know they didn't respond in shock they didn't respond and like anything like that it was just they were very like wow thank you for telling us we'll definitely be praying for you you know we really appreciate that you brought this up blah blah blah. And it was so freeing for me and although i didn't immediately have victory it wasn't like a magical conversation now all my struggles all the lust it all went away it didn't but it did it did help me knowing that i wasn't in that alone and it was my journey that began toward freedom of now fighting this not just by myself but knowing other people were praying for me that other people knew about it breaking the silence it did help me and over the next few years i would say i did eventually get to a place of total freedom where i wasn't in bondage it wasn't a habitual struggle for me anymore god really started giving me victory over my thought life and my heart and what was going on on the inside i began to see a more holistic view of sexuality i still had a lot to learn but just seeing more of god's design and his bigger plan and purpose for sex in it to see that also really helped me to desire to honor him in this area of my life in my single miss so for me bringing it into the light was one of the hugest steps and i can't encourage anyone participating listening right now to take that step if you feel like you're so stuck right now yeah so going back into that specific point because i know it's easy to think like okay well shouldn't i just confess to god i shouldn't i just work this out with him whatever it is you know whatever sort of sent it is like we have you know have had already women asked questions about okay fantasy porn erotica masturbation like whatever else why do you think that this is something you should confess or talk about with a mentor a parent whoever it is that you have in your life and not just deal with it like you and god. Yeah well i think that you know we see one galatians 5 talks about bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ like. As a body that is one of the primary ways that god uses to help us to grow us to sanctify us isn't just in isolation us in him if that were the case he wouldn't have given us the christian body christian church christian community we would have all been individual christians us and god living our lives but that's not his good plan for us he knows that we need christian community accountability and people coming alongside of us and bearing our burdens like galatians talks about. I think of 1:19 which says that if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and yes we confess it to god but as we invite someone else to bear that burden with us there is so much strength and support like i said accountability prayer it's like someone coming alongside you and saying i am going to go to battle with you you do not have to go into this battle alone you are not alone and just having that support it is such it makes such a difference and i know we want to think i can just handle this between me and god it's not going to be a big deal you know we don't want to confess it i didn't want to confess it i want i tried handling it between me and god and it didn't work because like i said synth drives in that darkness and we need the community we need believers and so you don't just run out and confess it to any random person you want to be really intentional to make sure one that if it's not your parents that it's a trusted woman i don't think it's a wise idea to go confess such a personal intimate struggle to a man i think it's much wise to go to a godly woman a mentor a woman in your church even appear who's a godly wise that you're like yes she's walking with the lord i can confess this to her she will walk alongside me i know i can count on her so you want to be really thoughtful and who you confess it to but i think bringing it into the like confessing to another believer allowing them to bear this burden with you is huge in your journey toward victory and you keep using the word journey which i really like and i've heard dr joyce cargo who was on early she talked about that word as well and you mentioned in your story how it wasn't like okay you confessed it to your parents and you brought it into the light but it wasn't like this instant fix like oh my goodness i'm just like totally free now so. I want freedom and i just want this to be gone whether it's a porn struggle or they're struggling with you know reading erotica fantasy whatever it is what does the journey to freedom actually look like and why is it important to think of it in terms of more of like a journey and not just like okay this like you you know switch on and off. Always thinking i can just stop this whenever i want but we can't we know that's not really how sin works and so confessing bringing it into the light is the first step but when we are so trapped innocent when we're so ingrained immersed is something that has been a habitual struggle i think we need to have realistic expectations that yes god's power is great he gives us the freedom in christ but we also with our sin and the flesh is strong and the enemy doesn't give up easily so we need to recognize that the confession is just step one of a journey of walking a consistent path toward victory with the grace with the power with the knowledge that through the gospel of jesus christ that he did conquer sin that we do not have to be slaves to sin but it's not something we can just one and done and we're forever fixed like that's not why she's died and you know he knows we need him that's why he gave us the holy spirit to walk with us in this life to journey with us in the ups and downs of our struggle and so we have an amazing little pdf over at girl defied a little shout-out all about masturbation specifically called masturbation is something about finding freedom you know with the gospel tools to find freedom it breaks down the journey i'll put it to do that. Yeah but i mean i don't know if you want me to get into some of those steps just like you know confessing that sin at praying passionately and persistently not trying to do this on your own it's not a pull yourself up by the bootstraps and just like conquer this and once and for all it has to be done in a with like a posture of humility going before the lord and saying i am weak i can't do this on my own i need your help. Memorizing key scriptures that will that you can call to mine and those moments of temptation of struggle to not just battle it in your flesh but to battle it with the word of god which is powerful against our flesh we already talked about accountability bringing it into like getting accountability i think it's so important to evaluate your life take inventory and and you know in this sex saturated. Culture we live in where anything goes it can be so easy to just slip into various sexualized content you know very erotic content a single christian women and not recognize okay this book is it's pretty pornographic or these images that i'm looking at these are not honoring to the lord and really taking inventory and evaluating am i fueling the less in my heart without even realizing it taking a step back and saying how can i feel my heart with what is true what is lovely what is honorable as philippians says and and really feeling my mind with what honor is the lord that's going to fuel a different passion in you than one that's filled by lush so just some steps that we can take on this journey again that pdf takes a deep dive but some of those steps were hugely helpful in my journey personality yes and no matter what you're doing with the guide on masturbation it offers you like such good practical steps so even if you're like but i'm struggling with erotica or i'm struggling with porn the guy on masturbation kind of helps with all of that just because the biblical principles and the steps to freedom are very similar so i'll link that and i'll send it out through email as well so you all can get that because i think that would be and it's really affordable it's like 5999. My basketball team and i we had started doing like a book exchange and everyone loved fiction and so we were exchanging all these books and i realized after a while like wow the books that i began to start reading and enjoying became very much like they were kind of like christian romance novels and they kind of progressed from there and i think they were you know some would call it like i don't know soft mommy porn or something like kind of you know these books that really they as a single woman they weren't fueling pure thoughts on my mind they weren't really pushing me in a good direction they were just kind of fueling this a lot of discontentment and a lot of just like oh where you know imagining what if this were my life and it just wasn't a healthy place for me and i remember one time getting a big black garbage bag. Going in my room and anything and everything that i felt like wasn't helping me out in that season of life i just threw it in the back to get to the dumpster and threw it away and that's another thing to think of like okay help yourself out you know like if you're having sex at home on your phone accounts are following on social media where you're like this really isn't pushing me that direction i want to go like do yourself a favor and just get rid of that so can you give us some other like okay the black garbage bag they can throw stuff away what are some other just practical things that they can do that maybe you did that would help to just kind of serve them and kind of get some of this stuff out of their life so it just makes it a little bit easier. Going through your social media i would say is one of the biggest nowadays because back then you know we would talk about magazines it's like do people even read magazines anymore i don't even know but we know we're on our phone and statistics show that we are on our phone a lot especially our generation and younger we are glued to our phone we spent hours on social media scrolling mindlessly getting stuck in all these rabbit holes of content and so that is one of the biggest places i think today that we are finding ourselves trapped without even realizing it because it's just whatever everyone does it's just so natural and so i would encourage you to specifically take inventory of what is happening on your phone what kind of content you're scrolling through what kind of content you're looking through and and then in tandem with that i would say the other huge thing that is all the rage today is just binging shows on netflix on apple tv you know whatever it is the binging and just like a friday night like i'm gonna watch half the series and there are so many fun things my husband and i love you know shows and enjoying things together but we have to be careful because what you used to be considered scandalous and like x-rated is now sleeping into all mainstream content shows that are considered just mainstream shows that everybody's watching have so many sex scenes so much ranch so much nudity and it's just like oh yeah i love that show that's a great show everyone's watching it like wait we're all just watching like nude people have sex all the time like this used to not be such a normal thing and it can be easy to just fall into that mindset of like well it's you know a little bit uncomfortable but it's kind of what everyone watches so really stepping back an examining like as a christian woman are the shows i'm watching the scenes i'm watching is this honoring to god is this fueling my heart for holiness for purity to honor him in the privacy of my home and no one's looking like what am i allowing my eyes to see i think about little song from as kids you know be careful little eyes what you see like it is so true and so taking inventory of what we're watching what we're scrolling i think those two things alone would help all of us have a lot more accountability for what we're seeing and then being intentional not just to you know put off like ephesians talks about ephesians 4 put off like yes let's put off but then let's renew our mind and what is true and then let's take the second half of that passage that talks about putting on like putting on what is right good and true so not just ditching like okay i'm not going to watch that show anymore and you know now what do i do like finding a show that's wholesome that's encouraging that could be entertaining but not take you down this rather whole of lust and sexual sin so the put off put on i think when it comes to media is one of the few things that comes to my mind right now and i was looking on our website girl to find calm because i just want to make sure you'll know of the resources there because i know for me when i hear about something and i want to start taking like i'm like okay i'm feeling brave i feel like i'm in the midst of this conversation i want to take that next step now it can be helpful to like access resources now so i know like with the book sex security in the longings of girls are like that's great but i might not come in for a few days i need something now so on the girl that you go to girl define.com shop and i'll link up below we have finding freedom from masturbation a pdf that you can download and that is one of our best selling pdfs so no you're not alone and needing that we have another pdf. Five strategies to find freedom from sexual sin that's something you can get right now again i'll link that for you and then another one. But i think would be super helpful battling sexual temptation so we have those three pdf that you can choose from and access right now and within those you'll get a battle plan direction scripture that you can take and say hey i can start working on this right away and i would even encourage you just like kristen did if you're like okay maybe it's not your parents i know we have a lot of women who are like i'm like 35 i'm single like i'm probably not going to call mommy and daddy be like i've been struggling you know that you might be you know go to a godly mentor it might be it could even be a godly you know at this age when you're in your 20s and 30s it doesn't even have to be someone that's older than you it could be a really godly woman that's younger than you that could really offer some encouragement accountability prayer and just like kristen said just verbalizing it getting it out there and you know what if you're like well i've done that and they just the person was kind of awkward and weird well that's fine you know. And they're just not equipped to handle this so it's okay if the first person you try to share it with wasn't quite what you expected really seek the lord and pray and have courage and and try again and finding that godly woman that can walk alongside you in this journey is absolutely huge one of the biggest questions that we've been getting and i know you have heard this to kristen is that these are single women. Sometimes think that well if i can just kind of hold out until i get married. Once i get married that will be the cure to all of my sexual problems like i'll finally be able to have sex and my husband and i'll just you know be able to live out all my fantasies there and i will no longer have these struggles and we have talked about that is such a lie but can you just unpack for us why that is not the key or the answer to a sexual struggle. Yeah well i'll just share personally and honestly there so i did conquer my struggle of masturbation i would say like my later teens and and i did believe the lie that once i got married you know like lord please help me get married one day like i was just so hopeful to get married and like don't you have to rapture doesn't come before he acts like random thoughts like that like i was just so hopeful for that and thinking that when i get married all of my sexual dreams will come true will be perfect blissful will have no problems and you know i'll never with any of these like lustful thoughts again. Wrong getting married was a wonderful and beautiful gift and sex with a marriage has been an amazing wonderful thing there has been a lot of like journeying even in that with my husband a lot of ups and downs but one of the things that really surprised me that i was not expecting was that once i was married my struggle with not masturbation per se but with allowing all of those fantasies that had fueled masturbation in singleness we're starting to come back into my mind like a 100 miles per hour in my marriage and i remember having moments of beautiful intimacy with my husband and then being bombarded by all of these thoughts that i had allowed to train my mind to stimulate my body with and my singleness they were coming at me and i'm like. These fantasies about other people other situations that is not bringing holiness into my marriage bed right now i know this isn't honoring my husband or god and so i remember having to battle with this for years and it wasn't all the time it would just pop up here and there but it really was in some ways like. A consequence like a long-lasting consequence of the struggle and realizing like okay we can conquer but there might be a long-lasting effects that we still have to battle and marriage doesn't just make all of those struggles go away and so i'm not sharing that to discourage anyone but to say that the struggles that we face in singleness like sin and it might you know we might feel like okay i'm not really facing these temptations anymore but then one day they might pop up again and for me that was for sure in marriage and so i remember. Having those same feelings of like i should like i should probably tell zack i should probably tell my husband that i'm struggling with this and ask him to pray for me to join me in just accountability knowing that this was going on but i was. I told him i just said hey this is what's going on i'm a kind of ashamed and embarrassed to even say this but i'm like having struggles in my mind when we're being intimate sometimes and he's like thank you for telling me he was so gracious so kind came alongside me he prayed for me and i just asked him i said could you just ask me every now and then how it's going like hey how are you doing you know how is your mind how are your thoughts how was your heart and he said absolutely and so you know i'm always like when he asks me like and then i also took it a step further as a married woman to share that struggle with my small group ladies like the ladies that i live life with in my church and i said hey can you all continue to pray for me in this you know it's something that pops up every now and then and i really want to honor my husband and honor the lord in my you know intimacy with him and so just yeah it doesn't go away we need to be made humble and singleness and not have this fantasy that in marriage we're not going to have any sexual temptation struggles or things that we have to even work through with our husband so the more that we get equipped on this side of marriage you know i just wish i'm like i wish i had a course like this and my single miss i wish i had a book like sex party longings and it would have helped me so much but i didn't and god you know his face full through each of our journeys but i'm just so thankful for all of you women who are engaging in this watching this learning and growing because the more you can be equipped and understand a holistic approach of god's design for sexuality now then if god has marriage for you you will be so much more equipped on the other side okay and this isn't really like a core part of the conversation but i do want to hit on it because it is such a question for a single women when they're looking out and saying okay since this is such a big thing. And i know that. Godly single men live in the same world that we do and there are bombarded by all these you know movies and you know all the stuff at the internet and it can just sometimes feel like okay how do i approach dating because we have a lot of single ladies looking to date in such a pornographic world and. Like when do we bring up those conversations what if a guy you find out you're dating him and you're like he is struggling with porn i mean this isn't a core part of this conversation but just give us like a little bit of direction maybe even a resource. Just because i know that's going to come up in there as they're watching this. Yes like why i'm so mad at pornography destroying so many lives under the guise of being the sexual freedom pleasurable act but it is just destroying so many people so it's just so sad but it is true that. Women struggle with pornography men struggle with pornography on the numbers are still higher for men but a lot of women struggle as well but as you think about dating i think it is so important to realize that because it is such a. Dominant struggle amongst people everywhere and especially high numbers with men to not assume going into a relationship that that struggle isn't present you don't also have to assume that it is but that's why asking good questions early on in the relationship will reveal what's really going on and i think it's so wise and so smart to ask really good questions early on it doesn't mean date one you have to be like tell me all your struggles you struggle with porn give me your history like you can get to know him and even figure out on a basic level do you click as friends like do i even want to see this guy again but i think within a few dates it would be really wise to take a deeper dive and turn the conversation away from just fluff and weather in the latest entertainment and take a deeper deeper dive initiating some of those questions of you know how is your heart how's your walk with the lord tell me yourself you should experience and then kind of taking an intentional turn to ask questions regarding sexual matters you know you could even say like pornography is a common struggle for people is that something you've ever encountered if so what is that look like and that might help you discover like if that is still a current struggle we have an amazing resource again at girl to find that we just released it is a question box that is incredible and it's i think 170 questions about how many it is now questions. And it is the cutest little box that's like a physical box that has all these little cards in it and it's something that oh there it is a little picture release. Yes amazing resource it is something you could take on those first few dates you know even and just say hey let's make this more intentional and ask some questions to get to know the heart of the other person and then with that those questions we actually also created two pdf guides one is all about answering the question what is biblical womanhood the other what is biblical manhood so if the relationship continues and you get past those first few days and you realize okay this is truly a godly guy who has a heart to seek the lord then digging into those guys can help both of you understand god's design for manhood and womanhood in all facets of life and all different areas as you can continue to work through the questions so another amazing resource as you move forward into dating i love that i know and that's an entire another conversation but since we're not on you girls we didn't want to totally get into the dating aspect but that's just a little bit for you so you have some direction like okay where to go on you all and the reason we're talking about all these resources is because the conversations here can only be so long and so it's not just promoting them for the heck of it it's like we have intentionally created these resources based off of what you all have asked for and that's why these like fly off the shelf because it's. And can be so life-changing for you and we just don't want you no matter where you are in the world to feel like you have to walk alone whether it's in your singleness whether it's in a future dating relationship even all the way to marriage and so we have created so many resources and the girl to find shots to help you and equip you and where amping up our digital resources because we know having that instant access in this very instant access world is huge i just want to wrap it up here and end on a word about the heart and about just like worship because we can do all the right actions but i know it really comes down to the heart and like having a true heart of worship before god so can you just close us out and give us just a picture of what like. I don't know what how true freedom is found in having a genuine heart of worship. Yeah well you know the old saying goes i'm saying it's like you can't you can't worship god and worship something else at the same time right like you can only fully and truly worship. What are the other and so if our hearts are fueled by less you know driven by sin constantly that's what we're engaging in we're not even trying to battle then the true worship of our heart is not going to be centered on the lord it's not going to be centered on his glory on being awed by his presence on him as the creator him as the designer we're going to just be stuck in all these ditches you know trapped in the mud and so one of the hugest ways like i said not just pulling yourself up by the bootstraps not just you know i'm going to do this like yes we want to have a battlement mentality for sure but one that is fueled by a desire to have true worship of the one true god who made us who designed us who loves us who sent his son to die on the cross for us like talk about incredible love while we were yet sinners. Christ died for us and through his death and resurrection he did conquer death i mean he did conquer sin and conquered death once and for all and as we place our faith in him and we see him for the the majesty beauty and wonder of who he truly is we see his character then i think our hearts will be awed by that and will be drawn into a relationship with him we will want to honor him we will want to desire him we'll want to pursue him his word will become sweet to us and less of just like something that we have to do because we are so i guess enthralled with who he is and so that is one of the biggest things that we can do in any of our battles whether it's pornography masturbation erotica any sort of sexual sin is to not just try to fight harder but to really turn our heart toward our one true god and to worship him more fully and the way we cultivate a heart of worship is by engaging in some of these daily practices of spiritual disciplines that might feel like okay is there any magical button or any more bells and whistles but it really is getting back to those basic things that god has given us which. Show me who you are increase my all of you increase my worship of you having those kind of heart cries as we approach the word and then taking that word that we read and then launching off into prayer and confessing our sins asking the lord to give us a desire to know him or to even worship him if we don't feel it ask the lord to give it to us and don't ever grow weary of that prayer so those are two things that we often view as like basics but then so much many of us don't even ever do that and i have fallen into that same rut myself where you just get out of the habit and then you're not even doing the very things the music god is giving us to draw our hearts into a place of worshiping him more fully so i would encourage you start today start tomorrow morning pick up the bible pick a book and just start reading and really asking the lord to increase your desire to worship him more. Wrap us up in prayer just praying for our single sisters because this can feel very scary and very overwhelming and just you know i think some of them are like well it seems like you're on the other side of this you know like i'm in the midst of this you know i'm still struggling and it just can feel so overwhelming and so i just think. Really praying for courage and for. Peace as they just prayerfully consider these next steps would be here. I would love to. Oh lord thank you so much for this time thank you for this conversation we praise you that you are not ashamed of our sexuality that you weren't embarrassed by are sex drive or feelings and longings and desires lord but you created us as sexual beings this was your good idea but we know god that in singleness you have a good plan for how sex is to be expressed and embraced and that is only within that beautiful covenant of marriage that expression of oneness between a husband and wife that plays a beautiful intimacy where sex is pure and holy and right when done to honor and glorify you and so we recognize god that in our single miss that that that's not the place for that particular expression but we know that you've given us these this sex drive and so i pray for each woman that she would see that her sex drive is so much more than just getting to a place of being with a man here on this earth but lord it is a way to remind us that you are a creator that are very sex drive points to that longing for intimacy and we know as christians that ultimately no earthly relationship can satisfy our ultimate longing for intimacy because they can only be found in an intimate relationship with you that you created us to walk with you that sex and we can live without sex but we can't live without intimacy we've said that so many times that girl to find because true intimacy is only found in walking in a deep and abiding worshipful relationship with you in that a single women we know that we can find complete satisfaction and so i pray right now for every woman listening that she would not buy into the lie that's satisfaction is only found when her sexual desires can be fulfilled in a certain way but she would see the truth and the beauty of her relationship with you that you you want to know her deeply and intimately you want to walk with her in a beautiful intimate relationship and she can have that right now she doesn't have to wait and i pray that you would increase her desire to know you increase your desire for your word for prayer and through that god would she find satisfaction in you and what she see wow the lord can truly satisfy my soul like the song says so many times that you are the true source of our satisfaction and so i pray that you would give that to her i pray you would give her courage. As she fights the battle against sin. Bringing her struggle into the light that you would give her courage and bravery to do that and determination that even if she's scared she would take steps forward anyways would you even bring to mind today a godly woman whether it's younger or older who she can confess that since you and ask for accountability ask for prayer that she would lean into the body of christ and no longer struggle on an island but bring in community just around her recognizing she's not the only one we all have our struggles we are all fellow strugglers linking arms and pursuing christ together so which she invite a godly woman in to help her in her struggle lord and i pray that you would bring her victory that she would see the journey ahead of her that you would give her strength for the journey lord and that you would ultimately bring her beautiful victory god be pray for this and ask for this in jesus name amen.
