Today on the girl to find show we are talking about popular advice that christian women give but it's so often unbiblical and we're going to unpack specific things that we've heard and things that we have probably said because it sounds good it feels good and it gives temporary hope but at the end of the day i think a lot of these ideas are borrowed from our secular society and they do not encouraging but they're not actually rooted in god's word and so what's happening is it's giving women false hope or finding hope in our circumstances rather than hope in god's word so today we're going to unpack what some of those most popular pieces of advice that aren't biblical and then dig into how we can truly encourage one another sister in christ with hope from the word what's up sister all the time we are so excited to be back with you again this week and this is a topic that i'm really excited about just because until somebody pointed out to me something that i was saying like i didn't even realize that i was giving advice and offering like this false hope to other women and actually doing more harm than good and i. I don't want to do that and i know many of you don't want to do that either so we're going to bring to light a few of the things that we've learned over the years that are kind of like easy traps to fall into but if you are new here first make sure that you're subscribed so that you can you know stick with us get the download podcast watch the videos. I want to encourage you though to jump into our latest book not part of the plan trusting god with twists and turns of your story because so much of what we're going to talk about today is learning where to place our hope that we should be trusting are we trusting in our circumstances are we trusting in this thing that might happen in the future or are like might change in this way and that's what's going to bring us ultimate peace and happiness or are we trusting in our changing in god who ultimately loves us and wants our best for us and so chris and i wrote not part of the plan trust. Journeys of of this process of learning to surrender our lives to surrender our futures surrender the way that things have not gone according to our plan and it's very it's like our most personal raw honest book and i think it will really encourage you so go to grow the fine.com i don't know where it came from but we thought of it maybe and it's called a fluffy feel good and it's when you speak a word to someone and i have done this so many times until my eyes i'm just offering this kind of like fluffy feel good piece of encouragement in their life and my attention to her very well meaning like most of us are trying to encourage people were trying to speak a word of hope into their very challenging circumstances but at the end of the day i realize that what i was saying wasn't actually rooted in the world it was very much rooted in just trying to comfort them in their chances but not really pointing them to the hope of the gospel to the hope of jesus to the fact that we can trust in that he is good that even if you don't get what you want that god still loves you that he is still in control and he does use all things for the good of those who love him for you know are good and his glory my fluffy feel good comments weren't really pointing and any direction like that and so if this is just kind of a wake up call for all of us and christian women to make sure that we are not adopting the lingo of our culture of our society the secular lingo that is very surface level that just not really get to the heart that does not really our focus our hope to the lord but rather just kind of puts a band on it that's kind of division that comes to mind it's like we're really good it just putting bandages on people's problems but it's christians we have so much more than a bandana we have the hope of the gospel of forgiveness of the savior of a creator the hope of eternity that this world is not our home that we're just passing through that one day there will be no more tears i mean we have so much so why aren't we offering it we need to be offering and many times we do but i think we can all fall prey to some of these fluffy feel good and so we are going to share some of the most popular starting with one that we heard kind of on repeat in each of our own lives as we've walked through what we unpack in our book not part of the plan seasons of infertility of longing in single miss which we thoroughly unpack and share how if we did not have the hope the true hope you get the gospel as we walked through some of these very challenging seasons i mean for each of us it was like a decade and continuing in some ways of these longing if we didn't have the truth of the gospel then i know for a fact i would be in such a deep pit of despair i would be so discouraged so good and it's only because of the truth of the gospel that i have that kind of hope and we know that like the truth truly does that is free of. Who we are as sinners and our need for repentance and our need for the cross and our need for christ like it doesn't feel good to think like oh i need that i am a lost broken shoulder but so much of the freedom and hope in life comes from. The truth and so this is convicting for both of us like this is these are things that we have learned and are continuing to learn and i know there are probably areas where i offer people fluffy feel good just to like ease the situation i mean we don't like a lot of people don't like tears and uncomfortable and even grieving so awkward we don't know what to do with it we just either you know leave or we say something that try to make someone feel better temporarily instead of having the longer view in mind and saying how can i actually offer hope. That sounds really good and sounds really encouraging but as believers were were like missing so much of the puzzle like imagine if instead of saying like it'll be okay and we give like a little pot on the shoulder if we said it'll be okay because god is good it'll be okay because god is sovereign it'll be okay because god sees your pain and he promises to meet you right there as you draw near to him like that's why it'll be okay it'll be okay because this world is not your home this pain will not last forever it'll be okay because you can trust of the world like. See the difference what is so powerful when we when we bring encouragement with the biblical truth behind it it offers true eternal hope for people so okay let's try then go to the ones that we actually want to share this is i love this conversation so much. So as i walk through my decade of infertility recurrent miscarriage so many well-meaning people and i know every single one of these people who shared this encouragement with me some form of this encouragement meant it out of genuine love like that i know for sure so i am not here to dash these people or say like how could they say yeah i wasn't offended by it but i knew in many ways that some of these words were not. They weren't actually rooted in the truth of god's word but the but those who were sharing it with me were trying to bring me encouragement and hope because my situation was very hard at certain times and they just wanted to be happy so they're like right if i say this it'll make her happy. God will give you a baby in his perfect. Is a clear indication that god has this plan for you down the road. Like all that sounds so good or date someone told me just be patient your time will come like your time will come don't worry or someone told me keep praying for children and god will give you the desires of your heart now all of these things they sound so good right like they are they sound so encouraging and so hopeful and like it's so positive and almost like yes if this could only be true if i could only find my hope in this but here's the problem. What if i genuinely believe that these statements were 100% true and then i helped god accountable to these statements and i said yeah i have this desire god hasn't taken away my desire for kids yeah god is going to give me this or in his perfect timing it will happen and you know what if it never happened then what is god a liar can i not trust god did he forget about me did he miss me like does he not see me. That is the problem is that when we accept a word of encouragement that isn't rooted in scripture we place our hope in the wrong thing and when we place our hope in the wrong thing that cannot ultimately lead us to a place of satisfaction because our hope is in the wrong thing it's in getting this thing that was never promised and if it never comes. There's no hope at the end of that road but if our hope is in the lord. And here's how those things could have been different if our hope is in the lord and at the end of the day whether those things come true or not our hope is firmly planted in the lord trusting in him and so rather than saying those kind of things you could say something like you know if god has children for you in your future you can trust him with that timing you know not saying he does but if he has that for your future or like you know i just want to remind you regardless of what happens god sees your longings but he also has a good plan for your life his ways may not be your ways and you can trust him because he is a good father you know or maybe god is wanting to do something different in your life that doesn't include motherhood but just know that he hasn't forgotten you that he does have a good plan for you and wants to use you to build his kingdom it just might look different than what you've always imagined those those are hard though like they're really cool. We can help each other to make sure that our hope is set in the right thing and if you don't have you know you like well i don't feel like i can say that and i just met this person and i don't really know them then you can just say something simple like you know i'm so sorry for what you're walking through i know i can see this is very hard i just want you to know that i will be praying for you and that isn't promising anything it's not declaring their future it's just saying i i see this is very hard you're offering compassion you're coming along side of them and saying i will be praying for you and then i'll be praying for your heart as you speak your trust the lord and i mean those are very gentle simple ways that we can speak to someone like so just a little example of the things i heard and it has really helped me was i talked to women who are all so into fertility miscarriage to make sure that i'm speaking truth down their life and a loving way and offering them encouragement. We know a lot of you are not in the season of marriage or is even thinking about your fertility cuz you're like i'm just looking for a man you know and you're like to get married i'm just trying to get married and i can't find him so i found myself in that place for many years longer than i wanted and i remember not even being able to think about having kids cuz i was. I had a lot of people say many things to me to try to offer me encouragement and to offer me hope and this is kind of a silly example but you know like at weddings where they talk okay and like you catch it and never was like next that can be so silly but. Honestly i'm very tall and i was in a lot of wedding stuff like all my friends got married and sister and like and so i got a lot of bouquets and ice cream mine i think i got like somewhere between 8 to 10:00 it was quite a few have you saved that ok google you know you're probably going to be the next wedding people would say things like that to me too like in that moment it feels so good and it feels so exciting to think like she's got him on the corner where is she like prince charming where are you and i you know he was going to be there and as exciting and thrilling as it was to hear some of those things in the moment. In reality they just weren't true cuz year after year prince charming must have got lost on the desert somewhere because he couldn't find me so all of those words of hope and encouragement. They just brought me temporary kind of excitement but in so many ways they distracted me from the season that god had me in and so god had me as a single woman for the first 30 years of my life and it took me a while to get to the point of saying. I have no idea what the future holds but i know right now my purpose is to live for god and to glorify him i can trust him with tomorrow i don't have to worry about whether he has a husband for me because i know he loves me he cares about me and i can fulfill my purpose as his daughter by living for him whether i am single or married and when i was finally able to trust that god had a plan that i could trust him that he would you know he would bring a man if that was his will but i don't have to worry about that i could just wake up every single day and say god what do you have for me today how can i live for you today i don't know if i catch a book that's funny but i don't have to you know live in this hope that my i'm going to my husband's just around the corner yes you know i am going to do this right thing so that god will bring me a husband like no i don't so much freedom so much life so much encouragement when i kind of surrendered my own plans surrendered my own dream and it really started living living for god you know i mean. There's so many things in that thing like well if you would just be content then god will give you a man like which is another thing that people said once you find contentment in your singleness. Then you'll be ready for god to bring you a husband. What what verse did you pull that from like a romans 2953 i guess the contentment part very very good you're onto something there like yes pursuit period on the fact that i have this desire is so this is going to be my future or anything like that so it's just important to i think wake up every day and say okay. Do i have a ring on my finger yes or no okay well i'm going to serve god wholeheartedly and live for him wholeheartedly as a single woman or one day if i have that ring as a married woman but my purpose remains the same i am here to live and to glorify god and that is the most important thing i can do with my dad and if you're listening and you are in that season of singleness and your longing for marriage in our book not part of the plan bethany shares so much like the whole journey getting into the nitty-gritty of like the hardest darkest place in her journey what she meditated on from the word how she found i'm talking about but really it's just such a practical guide if you're like yeah i'm struggling maybe for you it's like i struggled with or something else wrong things in a family or job for who knows but you're going this is not part of my plan and i'm really struggling to trust god then this i think will bring so much encouragement to you okay so the next fluffy feel good or the next piece of advice that's very popular that we have heard so many christian women give. Is the one that i think is going to stop on some toes because i don't think everyone's going to actually agree with us on this one but we'll explain our reasons why we feel like this is not biblical. So it is when people say that you need to forgive yourself. You know you're struggling with that you're dealing with that pain you know that brokenness that sin like honey you just need to forgive yourself and move forward and this is something that i feel like i'm hearing more and more just in the christian influencer world i'm seeing it in books i'm hearing it on podcast i've heard it at conferences and and i think that it's a very interesting concept i think it's very well-meaning i get the heart behind it i understand why it's being said that period. When we look in scripture when we actually look in god's word never in the entire bible from beginning to end we see this command this call to forgive ourselves as one of the necessary steps in order to be forgiven we never see that or to be free or to be free or to thrive or to move past something or to overcome a sin or to forget password. Never in scripture do we see this as one of those steps in order to find that freedom in order to move forward in order to get to the other side. But it has become so popular and i'm not really sure what is organs are like where it came from or why it is like such a popular talking point now when it comes to forgiveness but we just need to recognize that the bible never talks about this idea of forgiving ourselves you're not going to find a verse on it you're not really going to find any commands on it and so here's the deal though when we send when we have hurt others through our sin when people have sinned against us forgiveness is absolutely what needs to happen there is the bible has a fun day on repentance so if we have been together all of our sins the bible calls us to walk a path of humble repentant to be humble and repentant about our sin if it's against someone else to go to that person and to say i'm so sorry please forgive me i have sinned against you in this way the bible talks about going to our brother going to our sister if we send them going before god can fishing our sins and then says that he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. There's no more work that we can do there's nothing else that we can add to the forgiveness of christ when we genuinely go before him confess our sins we can bank on the fact that scripture says that he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness. Is that we walk through some of these steps and we might go through the motions or maybe we don't even go through these steps maybe we don't even confess we don't even repent and so there's this lingering guilt there's a stealing of like i just can't shake this feeling this thing i've done or this thing that's been done against me it just hasn't fully been resolved and so then we're told well i think what you need to do is forgive yourself i think you need to figure out forgive yourself to really move forward maybe that's the missing piece but i don't actually think that's the missing piece i think the missing piece is that we have an actually something that he promises but we have to receive it and accept it and believe it yeah and i think more often than not we don't actually believe that we are 100% forgiving of all unrighteousness i don't think we believe that so we we walk in this lingering guilt and shame the enemy is lying to us all the time trying to keep us in that state of shame lying to us that we know we're not really forgiven you know we can't really go over to people really know who you are trying to almost find our identity and when god is saying i have forgiven you i have cleansed you from all unrighteousness because you have asked for my forgiveness it is yours so we need to believe it and so i just want to read a really quick quote from an author i think they put it in a beautiful way of helping us understand this idea of true forgiveness. When we said we regret or bad decisions and we are remorseful over the ways that they have hurt ourselves and others the enemy continues to accuse us and remind us of our sins. Others in our lives might do the same. There are times we might even think it is repentant or laudable to refuse to forgive ourselves as if our punishment of ourselves will atone our sins. But that is not at all the message of the gospel. In fact the bible is quite clear that we could never make up for our own sins we are sinners who are dead in transgressions and we see that in romans ephesians john we are hopeless apart from christ. The gospel tells us that god's wrath for our sins has been poured out on jesus justice has been served. Living in guilt or self-punishment is a denial of the truth of the gospel. Reminders of passion can actually be used as prompts to praise god for his mercy and his grace current negative consequences from our past in can be reminders of god's faithfulness in the midst of them. They can be prompts to prayer and reliance on god for endurance rescue and transformation. Is actually truly just receiving god's forgiveness in its fullness that is what we truly need to do receive god's forgiveness and it's in its fullness and that there is much freedom. So i hope that was interesting to you because we don't need to chase after this idea of self-forgiveness rather just like this quote just like i've been talking about we need to truly pursue forgiveness repentance reconciliation and then receive the freedom that god offers as he 100% forgive us from our men. Another fluffy feel good and that is probably the most popular right now. Positive affirmations girl you're so brave girl you are so strong girl you are amazing you are the best you know. Okay so we were at a very popular christian women's conference earlier this year was it yeah yeah earlier this year and emphasis i don't know why but like a huge emphasis of the conference was. I like communicating these things to those around you like calling out. Qualities that you actually don't really know if they're true in your friend so like if you were to meet someone to be like wow you are such a courageous woman or you are such a or something like this like you're such a good mom or you're such a good wife like you are incredible but i really don't know if i don't know you i don't really know you or maybe you know as friends we don't really have that deep of a friendship and maybe i am maybe i'm actually not being that great of a wife you know maybe i'm like not loving my husband mobile on stage and they had them ladies who never met each other like affirmation words to each other when they really they didn't even barely know each other's names and so he was supposed to be just super meaningful time and people work crying and so the ladies behind us as these two women are on stage saying you want an incredible mother. You are so courageous in the ladies behind us are. How do they know that's true and i was like. And of course it feels so good to tell someone. That they're amazing and they're the best and they're just like crushing it in every area but that might not actually be the case and so often i guess it's good to encourage people with genuine know like i could see you know say you're you know you're having a hard day with the boys like wow i really see that you are striving to be a good baseball. You know i'm going to pray that god continues to give you the strength to realize you know to love your children well it's not like girl you are the best mom ever and you're like that you know that massage i just got really impatient like wow i actually need god's forgiveness write a positive affirmation you know so i think when it comes to those we interact with and those we communicate with let's try to speak things that are genuinely true like a positive things that we know for a fact or call i know that situation is really hard and i see you really admire that about you and saying why don't we call out the things that are actually true negatively about your husband just now but you didn't you chose to focus on the positive in this situation that really inspires me you know so those things that you can call out in those around you and things that you can say to those you just meet that are true like you know you don't. You don't have to say wow you are you are the best you are crazy. Point out the one thing that is true call out the one thing like. You know you're at the grocery store like i really appreciate how you smile at all the customers who come through your line that really brightens my day thank you so much for that you know you're calling out something that is true and angry face so we just want to encourage you to talk about the things that are actually true and don't just say positive affirmations over yourself or over someone else because it feels good and it kind of like i don't know after verse of the bible not pumping us up. But actually pumping up god and saying like. We need to know scott is awesome we need him you know seek the lord continually in chronicles like she is our strength fear not i am with you god saying you're fearful i'm not but i am with you right versus in isaiah my heart and my flesh may fail me from this mom's but god is my strength i mean that's the truth is that we are all very weak and we are all very needy we are all very broken so if we just try to pump each other up all the time we're not actually acknowledging our need for god and helping people find true strength true power true encouragement in the power and strength of god not just in our house. So the last thing that we want to share and this is another really popular one. And it is. Hobby lobby and tj maxx and everywhere and it is delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart. And i'm just going to touch on this briefly but this is just almost like a pet peeve because people use this first very well very well-intentioned but basically to say like hey just the light in the lord and again he's not smoke machine the light in the lord and he will give you the desires your longing for marriage just again find contentment in the lord delight in him he'll give you marriage or you know you're longing for children to delight in the lord his timing is perfect he will give it to you when he sees fit and i'm sure it'll be soon right just the light in the lord and that job you know that next season of life whatever it is that feeling from your sickness and he will give it to you and it's like we make god like he is so short of any machine and control him and manipulate him and force his time to be his timeline but what does this is really getting after and if you read the whole song you have to emphasize the right words and you'll hear a different message in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart it is that delighting in the lord when we are truly delighting in the lord we are truly satisfied in the lord and so guess what the desires of our hearts change because my number is my number one desire is to get pregnant have children. I'm not am i truly delighting in the lord know i am delighting in my desires my bullseye is my desires but if i'm genuinely delighting in the lord 100% finding my fulfillment my satisfaction that's what full delighting in the lord means then my desires they're not gone but they're not going to be my bullseye they are not going to be the greatest desire of my heart my desire my greatest desire will be to walk and not right relationship with the lord right and so it's kind of tricky but as we genuinely delight in the lord our desires are in him relationally and then everything else kind of takes a little bit of a backseat if that makes sense so. Pink clothing rather than offering fluffy feel goods we want to be women who are grounded in the word who are biblical who are encouraging women with gospel hope we'd love to hear from you go check out instagram leave a comment and continue this conversation would you add to this let's keep it going and let's be women who truly encourage one another with the truth of god's word.
