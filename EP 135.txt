We are talking about is it wrong if you do not want to have. A little girl and i am telling you the amount of times that i have heard oh my goodness you're so lucky you got your boy and your girl now you're done and it's just interesting that people have assumed like two is like already plenty and you already have a boy and a girl so you're absolutely done when i tell him like oh i mean we don't know if we can talk more but we would love to have more like oh wow okay you know and i just find it fascinating just the culture around having children and so i want to talk about not how many you should have but is it wrong if you don't want to have any at all or is it wrong if you only want to have you got your girl boy and girl hallelujah you're through i mean is that okay let's jump into it right now hey sisterhood it's christmas and we're so excited you're joining us for this conversation one that we need to talk about and i have a feeling that this is going to be interesting because a lot of you who are listening we know we have a wide range of this sister who are married who are single some married with kids summer with kids like what my struggle has been for so many years and fertility recurrent miscarriage those of you who are single and you're like i am not even close to marriage i've never even thought about this and then those were single who were like i really want to get married i really want to have children but this conversation is one that we all need to revisit because the mind set up our culture today like you said really is one of like. If you choose to have kids at all be sure to only have one or two and like you just i've seen articles of people who are shocked like when chip and joanna gaines from fixer upper when they had their fifth child i saw multiple articles of people like. How could they like this is irresponsible to have so many children like you know all these things i like this is crazy and people getting prizes for having fewer children we are living in a culture where it's not like you look at our parents generation or the generation before that like we're from the family of eight kids which shocks people and if you heard that for the first time you're like what yes we are sisters and we are eight kids in our family that's still pretty shocking but our parents generation the generation before that like our grandparents generation it was a lot more normal for people to get married young for people just to accept like yeah getting married growing up that's part of life part of the seasons you have kids and most people had more than one kid had more than two kids like four or five kids like bigger families were just the norm but we live in a new era where kids are a take it or leave it there if you use as an accessory their viewed as a burden and the mindset has shifted so even if you think like i kind of know what i want i kind of know what i believe like we need to take a deep dive on this and really challenged our perspective like are they biblical where is our mindset coming from this moment and it's really interesting because i have seen this real it's kind of gone viral and there are multiple people creating different sorts of this but it's basically of a woman standing you know in front of the camera and she's kind of dressed really classy maybe kind of sexy you know she's definitely before she is married and so it shows that she just like i guess thinking about the idea or imagining what married life would look like and so she has a wedding ring and she standing there just loving her life and then she puts the wedding ring on and all the sudden the camera flashes to her like cleaning up all her kids toys and then she takes the ring off and then she's back to like her single life or just like her engaged life or whatever you know pre kids and then she puts the ring back on and it's her like super exhausted and sweatpants like doing laundry and then she takes it off and it flashes back and forth between her life now which is portrayed as very glamorous so wonderful so easy and then her life fast forward if she worked to have children specifically and it basically how terrible it is how exhausting it is how she's basically losing her life and then the real ends so little video ends with her taking off the wedding ring and throwing it in the trash can and people love it you should read the comments on it like yes this is so great this is so true like oh my goodness you know when i just it's sad to me that that is the world that we live in where those are the kinds of videos that go viral because people are like yes having kids it's such a drain you lose yourself you lose your life you know it's just the worst it's just really sad to me that is so popular and that is the message the next generation is handing down to. As such a burden yes such a like we're losing ourselves and it's just the worst you know i mean. Yes like the ball and chain joke start with marriage like oh ball and chain like you're going to be chained for life like you're entering this prison when you get married like that's the narrative of culture regarding marriage and then children it's even worse it's like double ball and chain like oh if you're ever going to have kids like wait as long as possible like we don't get their yes which is why it's so important is christian women that we aren't passive about pursuing an intentional biblical mindset because we can't help but hear the world's narrative here the world's message like soak up the world you have culture we can't help it because we live in it day in and day out so much of what we consume so much of what we see that is the worldview that we're soaking up so if we aren't intentionally like we like to use this analogy like swimming against the current like we're all flowing down the current of culture and naturally and unless we as christians aren't intentional to say i am going to swim against this current by digging into god's word reading biblically gospel based resources curriculum like studying growing from christian leaders who are wiser and smarter and trying to understand what does god say about this where is his heart in this then we are not really going to latch on to the mindset of culture and there's a resource that you can actually get for free called set my heart seven day devotional for drawing close to jesus and that is something that we need day in and day out this resource if you're watching on youtube or instagram i'm holding up a picture but you can get this free by becoming a supporter of girl to find over on our platform patreon.com to find and it's a place where we have a small amazing powerful community of sisters who love girl to find who love conversations like this who appreciate this countercultural biblical perspective on relevant issues and you guys want us to continue on you don't want to see girl to find go away so many of you have said hey i'll find i can afford three to four dollars a month just support your podcast and your videos and when you sign up to become a patron we create resources every month and give them to you for free as a way to help you grow in your walk with christ and a way to say thank you for getting behind us and supporting the work of girl to find so this is just one of them set my heart.

Gods of a woman and it's really interesting because right now taylor swift is on tour yeah and there's been a lot of conversation about her from people who are obsessed with her and people who love her but disagree with her worldview and it's been interesting to hear how people have said you know people who are christians who really like her who have come out and said like you know it's they almost wish she would get married and settle down and like have kids because then they could relate to her continued to relate to her music and they're like always love you will always be swifty's but they were almost hoping recently that she would do that and she didn't and she kind of went through a big break up and his kind of seeing someone else and everyone's like oh we're here for it we're here for the rebound relationship but man that would have been so cool but i just think about it like wow this is a woman that is upheld as like i mean. I'm sure she is just the sweetest person i don't know anything about her but besides the fact that she is you know she's kind of in the dating realm she's in her mid-thirties she's close to my age and you know she's back in a new relationship definitely does not talk about having kids or wanting to you know settle down and start a family things like that and it's just interesting you wonder do we pick up on some of those cute from these people we idolize and do we yeah maybe wish we had that life or wish we had the glam and all of this and were like yeah having kids and it's kind of like man that's the board like i was trying to be out there so beautiful and famous like i don't know i just wonder if. That impacts us and that impacts our view yeah you know it's just you think about ya of beauty of the body like we had an episode recently all about that of like the cosmetic industry and how radically our mindset and our goals have shifted as women just with all these cosmetic surgeries that we have available the baby view beauty but even childbearing is viewed as a negative thing oftentimes which is why sarah gets her so popular now like this whole booming business we really want to have an episode on that sometimes just talking about that industry i mean and in some cases it's not just for physical beauty reasons but in many cases especially amongst celebrities that idea like i don't want having a baby birthing or even a c-section to leave scars to leave you know bust open my body like i just want to preserve this perfect body and children will mess that up and or to mess up one of the big ones recently was because she didn't want to have to mess up her work schedule yes yes and continue on with her life yeah it wasn't for health reasons it wasn't for any of that it was literally so that her life wouldn't be inconvenience with having to bear her own child right so even the mindset of like children are a burden don't have them until you have to have them there's even this mindset of like control of like okay well i want to have children when i'm ready and then once i'm ready i'm going to have them on my schedule my time it really is still so selfish all about me and then if you can afford it and you're apparently a celebrity and you can have someone else carry your baby so that you can continue on in your career i mean like wow things have taken such a downward spiral in my opinion a very dark turn but there is someone out there right now who you may have heard of her name is charles chelsea handler i'm not promoting her she's a comedian an actress doing all sorts of things but has kind of risen i don't to the top of mine for a lot of christian women a lot of conservatives are talking about her because she's getting out there and really promoting what she's calling the child free life and all caps on the free child free like you are free you don't have to have the bird in the way the chains of children and she's an older woman i don't know how old she is like 50s or 60s and she is. She is promoting this life and in fact recently she came out with her own t-shirt i saw on instagram and she's wearing it and promoting it on her shop and it literally the front a huge letters it says child free and crushing it and her whole mindset is that you don't have to have children like yes traditionally that's been the norm for women you know having children doesn't define a woman which i agree with there is some truth and not it isn't the ultimate pinnacle of womanhood by any means that's not what we see in scripture but it's this negative secular totally auntie child mindset of like they are a burden like ooh you know like look how free i am and she has videos of her like showing how free she is how she doesn't have the bird and she was not waking up to crying babies look how amazing this life is like that real that you talked about that other one and they're kind of joke but it's like they're for sure like this is yes absolutely and so an article on today.com chelsea handler literally said in america and honestly everywhere motherhood is treated as a woman's central purpose in life as if our destiny is to let a tiny stranger rip a hole through our pikachu ate the lady parts download from the inside out child the women are seen as unfulfilled unhappy even the pope is slam dust saying that not having children is selfish it's important to know when you don't have the skills to raise a baby you know instead of shaming people we should say oh good for you good for you for knowing that you shouldn't have a baby and she goes on and on just talking about this mindset of like again how free the child-free life is how if a woman doesn't feel like she wants to have one or should have one or is it capable of having one like taking care of a baby that is perfectly good and she's kind of like rallying women to say like there's a new genre of women who could have children but are intentionally choosing not to and it's a free and beautiful life okay i do agree with her on something i know so i know something true yeah she said motherhood is treated as the central purpose in life as if our destiny and then she goes on to talk about letting them through our bodies but that is true as christian women being coming from a mother on having children is not the most important thing about us and is not our ultimate calling we as christians are called ultimately to do everything for the glory of god and to make disciples and you know we. Motherhood is a beautiful and high calling but it is not something that should define our ultimate identity it is not something that we should be like i must have i mean we even see in in the bible who is it is it rachel that talks about give me children right i die for the first one joseph and then she's like before joseph she said give me children or i'll die with the lineage jacob joseph and then as soon as god gave her joseph she said the lord blessed me with this one now give me another one so basically like even having one wasn't enough. I think in a lot of cases made an idol out of motherhood and out of having children and that's not good you know christ should be on the throne of our hearts christ should be our ultimate worship and to say i must have children or this is the most important thing about me i will be i just cannot be happy without that is wrong that is not rightly placed in our lives and so that is not what we want to swing to either so there's like these two digits like don't have children and then there's like we must figure out what is the bible actually say right well and by the way yes it was joseph and been her two children yes and it's interesting that you mention that it is so important because like someone like me and a lot of women that i meet that i talked to even many of you in the sisterhood that i connect with through instagram through social media who are struggling with infertility there is a desire in your heart for children just like i have and god has blessed us through adoption it's been the most beautiful amazing gift ever but for so many years i was living in a child this home it was just a second me and it was a prayer of our hearts we would pray every day we would ask the lord for this gift for this blessing that we see in scripture that's a good and beautiful thing but something i really had to fight against was not allowing that that prayer for becoming a mom for having children to become my identity to become my idol where here i am praying for a good thing but like what if god doesn't choose to give it to me like where where is my identity found am i less of a woman you know am i not a complete woman if i don't ever have that season of motherhood or just god have a purpose and a plant even in this even if you choose his not to give us children i'm still completely hole in christ i'm still i still can be completely satisfied i can fulfill my purpose as a christian woman to make disciples to fulfill the great commission of going and why telling people about the gospel like i can 100% find satisfaction in christ and fulfill my purpose in him without having children so that is so true and i have grown a lot in that but that doesn't mean like that desire goes away like i still have it but i had to balance it and like you said there is a ditch even in fertility of doing something so much like rachel give it to me or i'll die like that that's how bad i want it but really making sure that our hearts are centered on christ and then even in motherhood if he does give you the gift of children like having the right heart focus that your motherhood like that season of life is all consuming right like now as a mother i'm like whoa this takes a lot of time school mom my mom calling me the young years have their challenges homeschooling has his challenge any season of motherhood has its challenges it's sacrificial you're pouring out constantly but making sure even in that that it doesn't become my identity like okay now i'm a mom like that's my greatest purpose my greatest calling like no i'm still a christian woman first and my ultimate purpose does remain to make disciples and it can be very. Being a mom is not easy and if you don't have the mindset of like it is my job to disciple these children to love them sacrificially like christ children can very quickly feel like a burden because they are hard like it is hard you know it's hard to take care of a tiny human that is fully dependent on you that you know like. Independence and figuring out his own voice and you know it is hard sometimes and patience doesn't come and i have to you know say sorry to him and repent before god and even ask him for forgiveness because i lose my patience and you know i get frustrated i don't know if you ever do that with your voice you have to go into motherhood and you have to go into desiring children i think from the right place or it can just it can become very overwhelming and i don't think in our own strength we are cut out for it we do need god's grace and his just kindness flowing through us and that servant hearted perspective to thrive in that role yeah i love which on piper says i'm going to read a quote here from him where he's talking about this the fact that children are a blessing but often viewed as a burden and just like some interesting ways to think about it so he says children are a blessing from the lord see someone 127 this is playing in the bible the modern resistance to having children as though they get in the way and are a pain in the neck is a sign of cultural corruption and selfishness. And so if that is your motive for not having kids know you are not obeying jesus if you are viewing children as that kind of pain in the rear end and you want to go on and do your thing without the encumbrance of having to care for kids then you have an attitude that isn't biblical but then he says i would never i would never comment childlessness the way the world commends childlessness but there may be kingdom reasons for not having children and i don't think those reasons can be elevated to normative or absolute. So we shouldn't require that if anyone just the same way i don't elevate the creation order to absoluteness like you must have children so i think that's very interesting that he's saying like in scripture we know versus like be fruitful and multiply we see that in genesis we see children are heritage a blessing from the lord they're like arrows in the hands of a warrior like all of these you never seen anything negative right about children and god giving them to families but he's saying as christians like if your motivation if it is because of selfish motives for why not having children then he saying then no you're not obeying jesus that's not a biblical reason to not have kids so really check your motives but he's saying it's the same time he's not god and he would never go to someone and say you must have children right now like that's god's plan for you so there is some like some open handedness of like okay lord trusting you for each plan for each family but when it comes down to our hearts it's our job to make sure our hearts are are selflessness and open to children and the sense of like trusting the lord recognizing that it is a gift and if we're saying no to asking ourselves like okay where is my heart motivated what is fueling this in and i love the episode you did with candice water oh so good you did two episodes you did one with dr leah gordon and then you did another one with candace waters they were kind of like. We are free in christ to choose marriage or to stay celibate service for his glory talking about forgot so we can choose marriage or we can choose to say single but it's for god's glory what we do not have permission to conform either choice to is the culture around us just as celibate service is a calling set apart to christ and vastly different from the swinging singles lifestyle displayed all around us so too christian marriage is a calling that includes an openness to babies people around us. Fully and when we get married that choice could come should come because we want to serve the lord more fully and so we don't have an option in life to say it's all about me yes and i just want to live life for my glory and my amazingness and my flexibility like that is a completely worldly perspective so. Nowhere nowhere do we have the option to just be. All about us as christians so when you think about getting married or you think about staying single it's like wow my perspective should be about furthering the kingdom of god making disciples and that can happen as a single or as a married woman but that should be our personal yes oh amen i know that and the other the perspective in that is that my job is to make disciples my my life is not about myself but a building about building god's kingdom sacrificing my time sacrificing my my desires just like christ did for the good of others and that is the opposite message that we will hear in society again we have to be intentionally soaking in these true soaking in this gospel perspective or we will buy into the lies that are single miss that her mother you know our marriage every season is about our desires our goals are bucket list our careers like whatever it is are us ourselves first and foremost will take center stage every single time that's our sin that is my natural default that is our natural default so unless we are intentionally growing in christ like this is that sacrificial love pouring out for the good of others then it's just not going to happen and one other thing can just water says which is so good and something that really helped i honestly helped to me when my husband and i were praying about adoption when we were praying about whether or not we should pursue this like seeking the lord's will it's such a big decision we were not like how do we know if we should do this or not one of the fears that was holding me back was the unknowns of how hard it would be like on the other side of adoption so not even just the process which is lengthy and of itself but adopting you know we were open to a sibling group of two to three children so we know it would be a very big life change for us but one of the things i was struggling with was like am i going to be able to handle this like this is like this could be so hard my whole life is going to be turned upside down what if they had issues and struggles that i don't know how to deal with like how am i going to get through this and i remember reading this book that i've recommended a lot of adopted for life by russell moore where he talked about so often the reason we don't say yes to something for me it was adoption for you it might be saying yes to having kids is because we're scared of how hard it's going to be and we view the hard as bad but he went on to say that the hard isn't bad it sinks us it grows us it gets us to think about someone other than ourselves when we pour out we are more like christ and it's in that crucible in that challenge in that valley in that trial that god grows and changes us and that's exactly what candice water says here she says by god's design one of the primary ways he changes us is through the crucible of marriage and family. Being changed transformed through being a wife and then if he wills a mother is evidence of his kindness he could have designed any number of ways to cut away our sin and burn away our dross. Often in the routine of his creation he uses the sweetness of marital and filial i don't know what we're talking about like. Tell your love to transform us it is not easy. Not in those exact words but ease is not my aim like the heart can be good god will grow me this will be great for me like yes that i actually got excited about it i was kind of like lord prepare me for this challenge so i think we really need to change our mindset about hard is not bad i was talking to an older couple they have been married for many decades and dave and i actually asked them we were like oh so you know what would be your advice for us as a couple like you've been married so long and so happy and you still like each other and you have so much fun together and their advice literally was like keep having babies and i was like yeah i mean we're going to try i'm 3044 like they had as many as they could but they were like it's so worth it like how does you can and i just thought that was so interesting that was their advice i want to wrap this whole thing up with some quick bullet points of five good reasons to have babies again this is from kansas water it's like we have lost so good so much of what she has to say on this topic and we loved it that conversation we had her on the previous episode so we definitely recommend going back and listening to that one but here are five good reasons she says to have babies number one. Babies are god's blessing like that's how scripture talks about it so we need to believe that babies are god's blessing number two babies are a part of god's good design within the covenant of marriage that beautiful act of intimacy can so often produce a baby and that's god's good design number three god wants the earth to be full of people god created us to create you know more people and humans are the only ones that are made in the image of god we're image bearers of god and we have eternal souls and so god wants the earth to be full of people the fourth reason that it's good to have babies is because married couples are called to make babies disciples of jesus we are called to be fruitful and multiply and then to teach them about jesus the 5th reason and i know i'm flying through these things are kind of the bullet points to wrap it all up the fifth reason is that heaven will be full of worshipers when you have children and you train them up to know the lord yeah they will spend forever being in the presence of god in that perfect satisfaction worshiping the lord and that's what it's all about one day you know not like floating on clouds like oh you know but like we get to come down and rain with christ into worship and be face-to-face a new heaven and a new earth as it was intended to be way back in the garden back in genesis how beautiful is that that we need to be a part of this kingdom more well it is so awesome you guys this is been a fast and furious conversation i know there's so much more that we could say about this is christmas by i hope this is just the beginning of this conversation about whether or not you know a christian woman should or shouldn't have children and their reasons for that i hope this just got your wheels turning and helped you to think of this question again this is every couple needs to take this question before the lord when they're questioning how many children the timing all of these things like take it before the lord and make sure that you are both rooted in scripture that your heart is in line with god's heart when it comes to children that you were thinking biblical thoughts about this so that as you process as you pray you're not coming and approaching this from a worldly secular perspective and then making choices based choices that are informed by the world but rather informed by god's word because trust me that will change the outcome of your decisions and i know we desire to be in line with god's word so coming out with us and let's chat more about this over on instagram if you appreciate this conversation like always and you've never left us a review and you're like i want to give a five-star review then please do that on spotify or apple it really helps our podcast and honestly encourages the two of us so please drop us a five star review and then again if you want to join our support team and get amazing resources every month go to patreon.com / girl define and then come back and join us next week for another episode of the girl to find show.
