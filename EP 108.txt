I'm not writing a donkey but i'm. I absolutely love the song mary did you know. I know we're going to get some mail for this people are so torn wait no i'm telling you ask anyone you know say how do you feel about the song mary did you know and you will get such a mix of opinions and yes there's like this joking around and it's it's someone says you know it's like a twitter twitter or whatever like anytime the song mary did you know comes on i say mary did you know. Oh yeah so about that advent stud. We created something for all of you people and i think i might add this into my at 5 days because what it is is it's a 5-day christmas advent devotional and it goes through passages 5 days at a time i'll just sleep over to the first page this is a resource we created here at girl define and it's a countdown reading plan you can't see it yeah if you're just listening it's a beautiful downloadable pdf and you can get it on our shop girl to find calm slash shop or if you are a supporter through patreon.com girl to find this is on there for free so all of you who support us go down to see it on the home page but basically just starting december 21st all the way through christmas day it has a reading plan starting in isaiah so going back in time the prophecies about jesus is coming and then it systematically works through different passages all included in the pdf so you just print this off you can take notes directly in it read all the scriptures directly inside the pdf it's all nice and easy for you bethany and it really will prepare your heart those last few days those five days before christmas when things can be crazy busy you've been like sprinting all month and now it's time to slow down and really focus on jesus and get in scripture as you build up to christmas day so this advent of emotional i created it from my sister bethany and i would like all of you to also enjoy it as well but that's good news for you right i know that we do have some really really fun memories from childhood though like oh yes so i was thinking you share one and i'll share one and hopefully they're not the same one oh we have oh my goodness okay my favorite memory so there are eight kids in our family so we're from a really big family and you know we don't have a ton of money growing up we lived in a pretty small house and our parents so love christmas special she is like christmas explosion to this day and so even though on like a meager budget you know all of us kiddos they would work really hard to make christmas morning super special and so one of my most favorite memories growing up as a kid is coming out of my room in the morning is this your memory too know okay there's lots i didn't know if i was like yeah because we have the same ones you know as being in the same family we come out of our rooms and they would take sheets or like pin sheets blocking all of the entryways into the living room and so as we came out of our rooms we'd go walk down the halls but we couldn't see what was in the living room because there were these big white sheets pinned everywhere and we all go into breakfast you know the kitchen and we need this beautiful big breakfast like bacon and eggs like orange juice you know all the things that we didn't really have on a daily basis and it was super special cinnamon rolls like all the yummies and then our parents would do the big reveal and we would all gather in front of the sheets and then you know like three two one and they tear him down and then we would all run into the living room you know seeing the tree with all the presents for the first time because they wouldn't put anything out until we were sleeping and so i don't know that for me is just so special and i'm debating even this year like if i want to do that with our boys because just like the sheet there was just something about like the tearing it down and like oh i mean i could get some biblical parallels with like to hang up the curtain but i won't go there so like we realize how much work our parents did right it's traditions and to make these memories because i am so lazy half the time where i'm like it doesn't matter but i'm tired like when we talked about it it's like those were like yeah every year without fail year after year they would create these traditions and seeing these memories another one that i think my dad's side of the family brought yes because there were no traditions from your mom's side traditions from your dad's side so they're called christmas angels and we've actually talked about that here on girl to find. A few times in the past but basically as soon as december 1st hits all growing up and it still carried onto this day some of the. Repeat it is is they're called christmas angels and all throughout december presents and so the way our family did it is they would get a bunch of like little brown paper lunch bags you know like those lunch box and they would draw an angel on the front just like a black permanent marker and then they would put my mom or dad a little gift inside the brown bag and then write your name on it and then out of nowhere in the day you would you know open the fridge or you would be leaving the house or something and you would see this little brown bag with the angel on it and it would have your name on it and you when you opened it up there was going to be like some candy or something like small that you really wanted and it was always you never knew like where you can go on that day where you not and as we grow older we got to participate so we got to also help by giving each other christmas angels and it was just so fun and like made the entire christmas season so special and now like i said period. She liked it but i think that it was stressful days you might give someone i mean i will confess like that isn't he likes it but he's not as passionate about it as me i mean it comes from our side of the family but we did start that and we normally start on december 1st but it was the last day of november and i was like i wanted to do one today and so i got the boys like these little organic chocolate milks and like little sunglasses from the dollar store like i went to the dollar store to load up on all of my like christmas angels for them because it's just like little trinkets and fun like little candies and. There their eyes when they but i was picking them up from somewhere and i put them in their seats in the car and when they open the door. Our youngest christian shouts. That was probably the most specialist kids but it's something you can do too with like friends you know like 30 years when i don't but that's a super fun one you can even do like if you're a college girl and you're like i've roommates it's just fun things that you can do to help their to be a little bit yeah a little bit of extra during the holiday season yes so there's something new that i started with the boys this year so for anybody with kids like this is one thing that i wrestle with every year and now having kids and i'm even like seeing my own heart struggle is that christmas like. You know as christians we want to keep the focus on christ like we don't want to become these greedy selfish it's all about me me me me me me and i can even find my own heart going there and like even in my traditions like oh no but we have to do it this way this is we have to get a real tree and we have to set up our lights on this day and all that you actually angels. Each day keep our focus on like having fun as a family but also blessing others and not just keeping the focus on us and like our funding what we're going to do and what we want to do like that's all fine and good but i also want to cultivate this heart of like thinking of others during the season and so the boys are all about like any plan that i have if i'm like boys i have a plan or like yes and so i told him i have this idea. Let's brainstorm and think about any ideas like any ways that we can bless other people whether it's our neighbors poor people in need even homeless people are family or friends what are ideas of how we can bless others and then we literally wrote down a bullet list of like oh like they would think of something i would think of something we write it down and then i said okay what kind of family fun do we want to have this month and then we just you know all the things we already had plans some new things even ideas they had like they really want to go do pop-up golf and i'm like that's great i don't love it that much but they loved it and so okay add it to the list just a family fun things not even necessarily things that cost money just time together like oh watch a christmas movie or whatever it is and so that was just been really sweet and every time we do it they run over to the list and then they want to cross it off like every time we finish one of those things and it's just really sweet like for example on the blessing others one thing we did which i have not done this in years but we made bags for the homeless like a little snack bags cuz we oftentimes driving around you see like homeless people on the corner asking for money and so i'm like you know i had the idea and the boys loved it and it was really sweet because just the other day we gave away our first one we have them in the car and like a little box these bags they just have like beef jerky and snacks and fruit stuff and just water bottle chips yeah and so they were like mama mama and so in in russian because our boys are adopted from ukraine they called him cuz that's the name for like in russian like a bomb so like hurry drive over there and so i'm driving like a crazy lady doing you turns and like trying to cut over and they're like he's moving his walking so i'm like literally chasing this man down so we finally get to him after like having to do with multiple lights and turn around and we finally get to him and the boys were so excited and it was just sweet to see like their excitement for wanting to give something to someone in need we rolled down all the windows we pulled up and just said like hey merry christmas we have this snack bag for you and he was so excited and the boys were like kind of nervous like oh mama you do the first one world little scared but just like for all of us together to serve just little ideas like that like things we can do to get our eyes off of ourselves and all the things we want and on how we can bless other people really really good one and i think it is so important to take that time just slow down actually like you know. Remember what christmas is all about because. Craft projects as a family and they make a really love that like it's one of the it's like really big deal in our church for whatever reason and so that's really awesome so i would encourage you if you're not in a good bible believing church which i know we emphasize this all the time and a lot of you are like i know i need to get plugged in i know i need to the christmas season is a great time because there's often a lot of just like joy and excitement in a church and so getting plugged in getting a part of some of those service projects or you know just like you're saying like yeah you can do that through your church so if you're like i don't know how to do that individually get involved in a church who makes a big deal about this and then you can kind of jump in and be a part of yeah oh that's so great okay let's shift gears and talk about some of our other favorite things like do you guys have any sort of favorite movies or favorite traditions that you and david okay so what we love to do on we normally do it. I think christmas eve eve what is that christmas. And it's really funny that is the cutest little memories but we look forward to it and we pick a movie that you know we both like and then it's like living room with our sheet like dividing but we get to be together without like. Christmas explosion because we have this year so we rotate every christmas day we rotate back and forth one year at his when you're at mine like our families and so this year we're at our families so our parents house for christmas which is going to be super fun we're doing christmas eve all day with his family but one tradition we have with them that's kind of fun is we always spend the night and so this will be actually like we didn't do it last year because we you know he just adopted the boys and it was like kind of a crazy year this year we're going to go over christmas adam yes and we're going to all like bring our christmas pjs we're going to do like christmas movies and just like fun snacks and dinner with the with my husband's family his parents and siblings and all the cousins and then we're all going to spend the night at the house so like one big huge sleepover and then even though we're less than a mile i just makes it feel like you're traveling like we're going somewhere or even though we're like going a mile away and then we're going to wake up on christmas eve with them and do like a whole christmas day we'll have our christmas eve service at our church that day you don't have a lot of and then we'll go to bed and then wake up and then do our personal family christmas just back and the two boys that morning christmas day before we come over to our families for christmas with them so it's just like so much christmas and i love it cuz i am like take off from my mom i'm a christmas lady and they celebrate big and it's just like very big traditions lots of fun so that's super grateful for it i'm just excited for this season and again like bethany said earlier if you're like me and you guys have a lot of fun a lot of family like a lot of blessings i don't feel so blessed i don't you know i have a lot of hard things that happened at christmas time then we do encourage you actually are most recent book not part of the plan trusting god with the twists and turns of your story is one that i would encourage you to maybe gift yourself as a christmas gift for get it free from the library get the audio book but not part of the plan will bring so much encouragement as you are looking at your own life and going this isn't how i expected to spend christmas this isn't these hard memories like this isn't what i want at this time of year or i feel alone you know i just oh my life isn't turning out the way that i always expected not part of the plan will bring so much encouragement as in that book we share a lot of our own struggles over the past 10 years our own journeys of life not turning out at all the way we'd hoped and how we found so much. Help and freedom and encouragement in the word of god as we ultimately trusted him learn to surrender learn to release our expectations and instead trust god with the plan he has for us so i would encourage you you know give that to yourself as a little christmas gift and enjoy reading that over the holidays if it's hard and i know that resource will bring a lot of help and encouragement to you and then again our five-day christmas advent devotional. And spend the last few days before christmas counting down reading all the scriptures building up to that big christmas day this advent this expectation this coming of christ and really help your heart be centered on the true meaning of the season i know you'll probably do this one because it's five days and i think i'm going to pull this one out too because i really like it when we just want to wish you the best christmas because ultimately we have hope in christ he is the reason why so much hope you know if we're just christmas days and. Presents and fun it's like that's so temporary but we have something so incredible in all of eternity to look forward to you know perfect peace and hope and joy in christ we get that for all of eternity with him so no matter where you are where you're listening what your circumstances are we all share that hope which is absolutely crazy we love you all so much and we wish you the most merry christmas and we'll see you again or you'll hear from us again soon.
