I wish i looked differently and i am kind of like unhappy and sad about this but is that the right perspective as a christian and how should we view our bodies as christian women there can be so much freedom and beauty to be found in each season of life with the different different ways and things our bodies does can look very different so let's talk about that and just encourage each other as sisters in christ what's up everybody i'm so pumped that you're joining us for this episode of the girl to find show i'm kristen. I'm bethany and we are sisters and you've got audrey again if you're watching on youtube you can see adorable audrey bethany's little baby girl the youngest member of the sisterhood which i have to point out but if you can't see you'll probably hear her every now and then especially when i say something really good she gives like a big which is an amen yes she's normally very happy the last episode of by god and that is what we're passionate about here if this is your first time joining us welcome to the sisterhood we are so glad you're here we're just two sisters chatting about god's design for womanhood in all aspects of our lives in every season single miss married have kids or don't. What is god's design for us as women and how do we live that out and find freedom in his beautiful design as modern women that's what we love to talk about yeah and we want to give away some of the freebies okay.

You will find this sense of happiness and worth in value as you accept yourself but as we're going to get into a minute that's not really what helped either of us and that's not what we see in scripture when it comes to how to find true happiness the film and how to actually glorify god and the body that he chose to give us so going back in time we're two sisters were the oldest of five sisters i know that alone will blow some of your brains in our family brothers christmas. Yeah if i go back 10 years or even 20 years from where i am today i would be so thankful for what i had going best 20 years so that's actually for all of us wherever you are today just know you're the youngest you'll ever be today and not that we know is christian's youth isn't everything in fact youth is an idol it's like has become such an idolatrous thing just like forever young like that's not what's praised in scripture is forever youth but still the truth is we are young people today and we can say okay god thank you for today and i can serve you with today so here's the thing it's easy to look even in this like right now we can all look around and say look well she doesn't have anything to complain about like she according to my opinion she's got what it takes she has the body that i want or the life that i want or the looks that i want and that's not what it's about you know satan likes to come and teach one of us individually with discontentment with ingratitude and so it doesn't really matter who exists in the world or who you are in the world like every single one of us can look in the mirror and shoot to find insecurities and thankfulness and just something like you know wrong air quotes with our body because there's. Always the temptation to send into compare in a negative way and so it don't you know you can't look and say well i'm sure she's never struggled with that sometimes it's the people you least expect actually struggle the most it's really true while you guys a lot of you have heard what audrey so cute you've got to go watch on youtube youtube so going back in time a lot of you if you've read our book girl define we talked a lot about beauty in that book because our subtitle is well it's girl to find god's radical design for beauty femininity and identity all three are linked together god did make women beautiful he made us feminine he gives us our identity so if you haven't read girl to find amazing amazing resources to this day our number one selling book yeah of all the resources we have so definitely go check it out but one of the stories i share in their you share some of your story too is. Many many moons ago i once dabbled in the modeling industry and it's just interesting because i remember i was probably like i don't know how old is 181920 something in their thinking and struggling with insecurities so like i joked in the beginning i really did hate my nose for a really long time like i remember this i would compare oh i don't feel like that was me accepted but there were just things i would i was super critical of my body and it was stemming from a place of one discontentment in in the body that god gave me my focus was on glorifying him my focus was on achieving what i thought would be the perfect look based on what i saw on society so i would see the magazines at the grocery store checking out i would see this was even pre social media yeah yeah i think okay that i had to certain standard in my mind of what a beautiful physically beautiful woman was and in my mind i just i wanted that so bad like i thought that is what beauty is and so i remember. Doubling like okay there was this modeling agency super short story but i ended up working for them for one year and i signed a contract they agreed that you know they would be a family-friendly agency they wouldn't pressure me to do anything that i didn't want to do like i could keep my morals and be a model which isn't really true by the way cuz that's not how things ended. But i just remember thinking like believing the lie like now that i'm a model. I will have no insecurities like i literally have this title i have a portfolio with this company like if you searched my name on google at the time it was like the number one hit and i just remember thinking like oh wow like i have arrived like in some ways like small ways but i think i think you're still the number one hit it just might not be all complimentary or both the number one i remember like oh man i thought this title like things are going to be like i'm gonna feel so confident like i'm not going to have any insecurities i'm just gonna love everything about my body but what's crazy is even with the title of being a model even working these jobs and working with other models it was so crazy how i became even more hyper-focused on my appearance more critical i compared myself even more than i did before because now i'm getting jobs on how i look and if i don't get a certain job then they'll tell me like oh you were in the running for that job but you didn't get it and i know someone else got it because whatever company picked her over me so it was just this struggle of like comparing more than ever and then becoming so disconnected losing my focus on why god gave me a body in the first place and like that my ultimate goal is to glorify him and so after a year of that i honestly i was like i don't want to do this anymore this is not healthy for me this is not pointing me towards christ this is not helping me be content in fact i feel worse off now than i did before i even had the title of being a model and i know that's true like we talked about kylie bisutti in fact i did a whole interview with her previous victoria's secret model she it's like i don't know what episode but we also talked about her in our book like talk about it we'll link that link below achieving the top top and even she as like a victoria's secret model was saying the same thing like the models. Beautiful women in the world were some of the most insecure because that is when comparing that is when idolizing your body that's when it happens to the most you're hyperfocus on it you're getting paid for it it's your everything it's your all and it's not enough to satisfy so that's i just want to get that out there first and foremost that it's a lie that if you could just achieve that certain look that then you would find satisfaction on the other side i think the area that i was most confused about and it's kind of weird just talking about this actually just didn't. I really didn't understand i don't know. Like i just thought that if i were skinny that that was kind of the essence of being like a beautiful woman and for me i had a lot of health issues like migraines specifically but i just thought like the most important thing in the world is to be really skinny and to have like the flattest stomach in the world and so even though i wouldn't have considered myself like a dieter i do have memories of like you know restricting my diet so much because i thought that was like such good self-control and i thought i was one protein bar and it's already like 4 p.m. like i am doing so amazing because i thought oh to be so skinny that's what it means to be a woman to be so skinny that's what it means to be like oh you know healthy not realizing that. Migraines to actually get serious about okay. What should i look like as a woman and what do i have to be like the super ultra skinny person. Is that like even good is that even healthy and so for me i've done like a lot of revamping my thoughts and my thinking and just asking myself like okay why did god create me as a woman and why what is my purpose here on earth and i've had two two babies now two pregnancies and. My body has changed a lot since then i mean i'm obviously nursing audrey full-time and yes i know this sucks some people and scare some people away but my son gave you three years old he's still nurses here and there obviously it's like chick-fil-a nuggets but he still likes to nurse and some people are like like you know have a heart attack i now have changed my mind so much like wow appreciating. The this ability that god has given me and instead of wishing it away because my body has changed a lot because of pregnancy instead thanking god like god wow thank you so much that. You allowed me to do this thank you that i'm able to nurse my children you know thank you for my body that's been able to do this and right now it's like i'm only 3 months postpartum i do not look like i did even before i had audrey but that's okay like there's so much appreciation in my heart for the fact that she's here and then she exists and that i can nurse her you know it's like that's amazing to me and so when i look in the mirror and i see okay you know i do have a pair of jeans but not quite like they used to you know and so it's just a totally different perspective it's more unappreciation for the femininity for the womanly this and just recognizing to like i have a uterus men don't have that so my stomach is going to look different from a man he's able to get a really flat stomach like i have an entire organs in there that he doesn't have like it's just a completely different world view and then eating her that body that god has given me rather than restricting to try to be this bean pole because i think that's what it means to be a woman and to be beautiful so i have found so much freedom and living that way. Had to take her to the emergency room because we didn't know it at the time but now we we found out that she has a really severe port wine stain all over her right leg. One of her legs and extending up into her back and so as she gets older. Sweet unique thing about her but also for audrey to say you know that's not what defines your worth you're worth isn't found in whether you have the exact same color legs or not you're worthless founding christ and he loves you so much and he gave you legs to to walk and to serve him into bless others not just to be all about you and what people think about you and so i'm just so grateful that god's been working in my heart because i hope that i can raise audrey to find her worthy in christ in a knot in her house period when you were talking is one thing you said being pulled and i have to crack up because her nickname when we were little kids was mean like three years ago she like that she wants you to be a mean so the interesting thing that i was thinking about though is that you had this certain standard of beauty in your brain and it was like being pulled like i need to be a skinniest possible i'm not going to eat anything until 4 p.m. it's going to be one protein bar and i crushed it for the day you know like seriously i remember it being that way too but like i had a certain standard of beauty too like the model like the pictures i was seeing what i thought was beautiful and so i think for like as you're listening right now to this conversation i want you to think about where is your standard of beauty coming from like what whether it's in the past or even right now like what has shaped what you view as beautiful. And then really take it a step further and think like okay like if i'm being really influenced by culture if it's the magazines if it's the thousands of images i can scroll through on instagram or these social media platforms with perfectly airbrushed people filters like it's it's like next level today it is really challenging today because there's just so many things that aren't even real with all the editing and stuff but just thinking like where is my definition of beauty coming from. And is it in line with god's word. I think that really gets to the crux of that like is my one my definition of beauty is that in line with god's word and his heart for women for femininity for what god values or is it coming from the world and then to how do i view my body do i view my body as just this body that i need to almost fight against and have these internal battles with where we view our bodies almost the enemy and like something that we have to like. Make it become perfect or do we view our bodies as a vessel something that god has given us ultimately. To be used as a vessel to serve him to serve others and to glorify him ultimately and i think if we get to the heart of each of those questions you know what's where's my definition of beauty coming from. What how do i view my body what's the purpose of my body then i think that will really i don't know help us work through some of this because i know for me it wasn't until i actually thought about those questions that i was able to recognize that beauty had become an idol in my life that i had a very narrow very specific. Version of what a beautiful woman was and i was chasing after that and finding myself more empty than before i was serving myself i was so focused on my heart wasn't focused on the lord and it's interesting cuz if you look back like there's all these things on social media of like the past 50 years of beauty and how it's changed and you guys are probably seen some of these right where it's like the 1950s woman the 1960s woman 1978 is 90s 2000 all the way to this day and it's shocking like there was this one girl and she took her own picture have you seen that one and she took her own picture and she ended her picture to wear her body type changed every decade so she said my body as a 1950s woman and it was like real our glassy real curvy marilyn monroe style and then you know my body as a 1971 and it's like this boyish figure and she ended her body to actually look like that. And just to realize like not only are we off and getting our definition for beauty from the world not from god's word not what he says has eternal value what matters most we're getting it from the world but the world's definition isn't even staying the same it's like changing every few years every 10 years and so it really is this never-ending cycle when we're pursuing beauty from the wrong perspective we can't win yeah. You know they're just saying something maybe making an observation they don't realize maybe it's something that's kind of difficult for you how do you respond to that internally like does it you know do you allow it to cause you a ton of anxiety and you just it ruins your day and you know you need to go and you know fix it whenever the thing is or are you able to turn to christ and say god thank you for the way that you have made me thank you for the no shape you've given me thank you for the height that you give me on this test happened to me several years ago something happened to me too okay i want to hear what happened i mean this is the angel story when i was with my dad but this was before i was married and i walked into a restaurant in the hostess before she greets us before she says anything she just stares at me and she's like. You are freakishly tall just like and that's it and i'm like. What do i say to that. And we are really tall like i said we're both 61 we are very tall for women we are very very tall and we live in the south where it's not the tallest of people so just the facts you know so it's like we're very very tall everywhere we go sometimes we go to the grocery store and it's like we're giants but i remember in that moment. Thinking i was like you know like that is quite a shocking statement but this doesn't ruin my day and this really doesn't like i'm not really bothered by this because i've come to grips with the fact that god has made me a very tall woman and that my life isn't about serving myself and getting likes and getting attention and it really doesn't matter if she thinks my height is good or not like she's not my creator she didn't make me god designed me and you know i can live for him with this height you know i don't need to be any shorter in order to live for him he's not mess up the positive story you know yes but i just have people you know people can say terrible things about you were calling you a freak and it doesn't have to ruin your dad is in christ you can go on with a smile on your face and literally not even think about it again i mean yeah i told the story over and over because it's kind of shocking but it is freakishly tall i know mine is like it's not quite that traumatic i mean i have had people regularly to the state people comment on my height you're really tall and they love to make that statement and we always joke as tall girls like. Thanks i know and you're really short why are we supposed to say that it's just so funny they used to ask you to play basketball in my youth but now they don't really ask me that anymore they always ask me like siri. People don't do things like that don't listen don't don't don't don't don't i i okay i will be honest like i had never really thought about it to be honest and so i wouldn't evaluated and i was like you know i think i do have like a neck that's a little longer then maybe the average neck but i didn't have a problem with it i don't feel like i'm out of proportion if i am that's fine too but i had to wrestle in my heart with just like this thing about me that i can't change there's nothing i can do about the length of my neck but it like you said it really puts it to the test and that moment when people make those comments of like. Do i fear man and am i so anxious about this comment. That i'm going to start feeling insecure am i worth in value is based on this that now i feel like i need to manipulate and change this this. Unchangeable feature about me or just be insecure about it and like maybe we're more scarves like i can't really do that in texas but like i don't know try to hide it we all have those things right and instead like i did have to think about it and kind of process it and like i will be honest like i was tempted to feel kind of insecure like wow if they're noticing maybe everyone maybe all people see is just my neck every time they look at me you know where i like your brain takes you and just going back to the basics of like okay no yes i am fearful and wonderfully made like thinking of someone 139 but i'm not just fearfully and wonderfully made for my own self for my own purposes for my own identity i made this way because i am a vessel of the lord and as a believer as a christian woman i know that my identity isn't found in how i look in the physical body god made me yeah the physical body god gave me is a gift and is something that i can use to serve him to glorify him and to serve others with you know in whatever capacity that he calls me to and so that's the purpose of my body it's not to fit some mold of the world standard for beauty or to even fit the opinions of other people so i think that's so important that when people ask us that how do we feel in the depths of our heart and the place that no one else ever sees how are we responding and i think it is a good test to see if we are if our identity is firmly rooted in the lord or if we are responding more in the fear of man so i just want to challenge you to do this little exercise sometime. Help me to use the words that i speak with the amount that you give me to bless others to point others to you let everything that i do be done to glorify you so it's not about me it's not just about how loved and worthy and great i am saying god you yes you do love me and you do call me your child if i trusted you and i do take on that identity and that inheritance and you but why am i here what is that purpose it's not ultimately about me it's living for you and it's just so cool when we take the focus on the pressure off of ourselves and say it doesn't really matter like i am here to serve you help me to live healthy and eat healthy body so that i can tell others about you so i can love my kids well so that i can love my husband well so that i can serve in church well you know all of that i just think it's so cool to just do that exercise every every once in a while to kind of get the focus back on. The different shapes and sizes that we all are in appreciate the differences and say wow god is so creative god is awesome now let's use the body she's given us to glorify him and we see first corinthians 6:19 through 20 says do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit who is in you who you have received from god you are not your own you were bought at a price they were for honor god with your body we've heard that person a lot but it's just reminding all of us that that's where it's really at our bodies are a temple of the holy spirit it's not about us god died on the cross bought us redeemed us brought into his family by his saving grace and his death and resurrection so therefore because you are a daughter of god honor god with your body and having that mindset is helplessness on her own families and then like you said eating too nourish the body we have yes exercising we all in different ways to exercise not overdoing it to punish our bodies but to cultivate a healthy body a healthy temple to eat foods that nourish our bodies that equip our bodies for the work that god has for us like it's so much more free when you can say yes i'm exercising i'm eating healthy my body is nourished and i can accept the body size that god has given me and i can use the body to serve him y'all so good we want to hear from you come hang out on instagram and grab a copy of our book girl to find if you haven't read it if you appreciate conversation like this share with your friends leave us a five star review and we will see you guys next week.
