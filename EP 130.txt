Botox fillers injections cosmetic procedures this seems to be the norm now amongst a young women amongst older women is just like that you get your fillers you get your cosmetic procedures done because you've got to be the most beautiful woman right is this right or is this wrong as a christian is this something we should pursue or should we push back on this and say i'm not so sure if i should be going down that road let's jump in and talk all things botox fillers cosmetic procedures right here on the girl to find show hey sisterhood is kristen and bethany here and we're glad you're joining us for this conversation because if you're on social media then you see this everywhere you see ads for the latest and greatest skin care everything and you see it seems like what you used to be only celebrities and maybe like hollywood people like famous and rich people would get lip fillers would get botox cosmetic you know tell me talks in boob jobs like all the jobs it seems like it was just the rich and famous but now things are changing things are less expensive they're more accessible and it seems like your everyday common girl is getting a lot of these things and so it's leaving other women going well wait a minute you know you start comparing you see on social media and you're like well maybe i should maybe i should jump on that way give me maybe that would really help me and you know it's a good question like should we jump on should we not is there a balance how do we think about this and so i'm so glad you're joining us because this is a conversation that is much needed for us this christian women to take a biblical look we know the word botox is in the bible but we know god has a lot to say about our motives our hearts but we should value thinking of eternity but we all know god created beauty that god created women that he made us beautiful that he gave us physical bodies and so how do we take care of them and appreciate the beauty and even pursue the beauty and not neglect them but not become obsessed about it right and idolize it well and in america alone there are 15 million and i'm sure it's getting more than that by the time you even listen to that million cosmetic procedures that are done every single year and of those 15 million people 92% of those are women.

Patreon.com we have to get this out in the open though have you had any cosmetic procedures botox fillers anything like that done and this is not. Are you asking me or the sisterhood i'm asking you oh it sounded like you were asking them i would like to know as well come in instagram define wait. It's very well to say there's no difference between men and women there's no difference between the genders but you look at a statistic like this this is just a side note 92 of people getting cosmetic procedures done are women. The only one that comes to mind is something that i had done the only one know now everybody's interested they're leaning in like what. I don't know i guess this would be considered a cosmetic procedure back when i was like 13 14 years old i had some work done on my teeth. And this wasn't necessarily i guess like a pursuit of i want to have more beautiful teeth so let me go get this done it was originally presented as an option by my dentist by our dentist all the time as a solution to fill in this gap that i had in the front of my teeth and instead of getting braces because the rest of my teeth were pretty straight he recommended to me to my parents like hey. What if we just do bonding on the front of your teeth and what kind of fill in the gap in the space i think one of my other teeth in the front never actually fell out i never got my big tooth so it's like really tiny and he's like if we pull it there's no chance like the big tooth will come in so you'll have to get like a fake tooth i guess that he's like or we could just fill it in with bonding and like round out that small tooth make it look normal so i have had that done so on the front of my teeth there is some bonding work which did improve my smile which did improve i think my overall appearance of my mouth and my teeth in general and so boarding to your perspective oh heroes elizabeth it's kind of trending a little bit which i'm kind of like maybe i shouldn't have no no i'm happy with what happened and i just think it for me if my mouth feel more balanced and stuff so do you have any plans oh i'm sorry do you have any plans. I see what's on social media i see the before and afters of certain things and i'm like wow that skin like her skin does looking credible. That would be awesome like i wouldn't mind if my skin looked that good and so i will say there's like there's been temptations there's been thoughts and patience and it's wrong or just play that we're going to get you is it wrong you know. We highlight our hair i mean little side note there like so is that wrong. So it is interesting for each of us we draw the line at different places and we judge other people who are on the other side of our line and we're like oh look at her how could she she doesn't understand god's design but then we have certain things we do to improve our parents anyways we're going to get to that so the one thing okay we come from a line of skin in our family that tends to i think age more quickly than some like get really wrinkled i've never had a problem with my skin though. I'm saying like as we age in our family the wrinkles are. Like just much more prominent i think it's like a genetic thing like if you look at our great grandma mom like it's just genetics and it's just the reality of like the type of skin we've been hearing. Talk about your own skin okay well i guess you don't share the same genetics i'm trying to find a mirror but i don't mind i never really noticed my. More wrinkled than the average woman at that age because of genetics so like is it wrong if i do some skin care you know even if something extreme quote unquote like botox like. No not nowadays it's not it used to be used to be considered pretty extreme but it's very common now so it's not and like. I've wrestled on my heart like. What's my motivation and not like. I don't think in good faith i could go do that i don't feel like my conscience is in a place for me where i would feel like my motivation would be right or my perspective of even beauty of aging of wrinkles like at this point in time so i haven't but i remember we have this conversation like a few months ago and i remember because you were like oh it's just like you know you have to catch on it before i guess they get too bad and i remember yeah and i was like you should do it. What sound device not even asking how is your heart and all of this song to me i don't see on the surface like i don't think that it's right or wrong like i don't think you can put botox out there and be like this is a sin or this is wrong i think it comes down to in these. It has to get to the heart but i think so many of us have just gotten so. Like so what do you call it like overtaken with what we're seeing so immersed absorbed in the cultures usefulness that that is without even realizing it a big reason for why i think i was just saying it as like a sister like if it really bothers you that much just go get it you know not like yeah i mean i haven't had any cosmetic procedures done i've always had a crooked nose you know and that kind of like not symmetrical face but it's like i think those are the things that make you unique like i don't really care that i know people always say like here's my good side it's like i don't even know my good side you know like i think i look decent when i look in the camera but i'm like i don't know if somebody's like i don't know and then my lips have always been on the smaller side but. Honestly until like lip fillers became a thing it's not even something i ever thought of you know and that's the interesting thing and that you're not getting out of this question either i'm about to ask you but i think that in some ways we are presented with opportunities for things that we never thought about that before and so it's almost like things that women from 100 years ago would not have been insecure about they would not have been questioning even me and like wrinkles and i honestly think it's the only reason i'm really even thinking about it is because of how many women my age and their mid-30s are getting botox and and like let's be honest their skin looks really good i think in many cases it's like wow it's smooth it out it just looks like clean and fresh and in many cases looks really healthy looks youthful i mean that's what we're after right like getting rid of those wrinkles and i don't think it's something that would have been on my radar at all had i not been faced with this reality that so many women in my age are pursuing these things and like oh wow yeah i their face looks really good like let's be honest and so it's not something i think women from years past week there have been struggles beauty store forever in different ways like whether it was the corset or like how skinny or. Everything is well pornography one like these perfect addictive videos that so many people are addicted to men and women know yeah i mean i hear that it's videos picture of flawless women just like. That the peak of physical perfection and so yes that's a whole nother i think aspect of it as well but let's turn the question on you really quick because you didn't answer have you had no i don't think you did if you had anything done or if you plan to. No i haven't had anything done because if i did you probably would be able to tell more i. If i were to get something done like i said it probably would be if i were like just going to get anything i think it would only be like super minimally invasive like. Maybe lip filler something like that but i just. To me i don't know it just you thought about the fillers though no not like seriously but i just when i if i ever start to think about it it's also i have a daughter now too and that really makes me think about it differently like. What a message am i sending to her as like her you know mother and the one she look up to me and she's only 5 months old right now but it definitely makes me think even deeper about this stuff what kind of you know where i want her to find her identity and like you know what i want her. Just about the example you're setting and what you're telling them through the choices that you make so i don't i definitely don't have any plans to get any sort of procedures done just because for me i know it would be a very shallow reasoning and it really wouldn't be i don't think my heart would be in the right place yeah. Which is something that i really want to get into because i think it can be easy for us as women as christian women to think that we have a biblical worldview regarding beauty regarding youthfulness regarding aging to think like oh yes i'm a christian i know god's word but then really what's a motivating our decisions what's fueling our insecurities what's fueling our comparison what's fueling us to idolize certain aspects or critique ourselves or long for certain things beauty wise that's not being informed by god's word that's actually being very much informed by the cultural around us what we're seeing on social media what we're seeing on those you know highly edited magazines that's another thing the digital age has brought about not only. Cosmetic surgeries that allow to allow us to look more useful and perfect our bodies quote on quote but also the editing and all of the pictures that just take things takes even beautiful women naturally and make them even more beautiful but it's unrealistic so we're like for me it just comes back to again and again like. What is fueling my motivation my worldview if i look in the mirror and i'm like oh look at those wrinkles oh my goodness like wow they're more prominent whoa i didn't notice those lines on the side of my mouth till today they look really it's like where is that coming from and why am i doing that as such a negative thing there's something happening inside of me some worldview that i'm viewing my face as i look in the mirror through some lens and like i mentioned earlier so this is according to the cleveland clinic article they say cosmetic surgery is very common every year providers do more than 15 million cosmetic surgery procedures in the united states alone more than 13 million of those are minimally invasive procedures a lot of what we've been talking about people of all genders and ages get cosmetic surgery these procedures are more common among adults ages. Between 40 and 54 which is interesting yes. I'm coming to the age of the cosmetic surgery i'm 34 she's 36 women get around 92% of cosmetic surgery procedures and then the next quote by the cleveland clinic is really interesting because it kind of shows the addictive nature of these procedures lip fillers typically last 12 to 18 months however it depends on your age and how fast your body breaks down calories into energy metabolism younger people tend to bring calories faster so lip fillers don't last as long same thing with botox it doesn't it's like okay a few months and then you have to get it. But it's something that you have to continue to get going and you know when you go into those offices a lot of them are like here's what else we can do so in a lot of cases you see people who kind of. Get addicted to these procedures or like they started out with getting like lip colors that looks kind of natural and all the sudden it's like wow you can really tell they have little or same thing with like eyelashes eyebrows you know cheek like a buccal fat removal these things were from the sometimes when you're stepping back you're like oh wow i can really tell they've had work done but i think when you are just starting out you don't realize like how addictive that process can be because you have to keep going back and it's just like well now that i've done that what about this what about that so i think there's. It might not be that noticeable it might not even people might not even think you've had any work done because it just looks more natural but as you age it's not natural for older women to look like 30 year old women like that's not natural and as you can continue to age or very nearsighted as young women we don't think down the road like what are you going to do your eventually going to run into a problem are you going to stop the botox are you going to stop the pillars like when it starts to look really really unnatural are you going to keep doing it and then one day wake up and look in the mirror and think like whoa what is like my face and there was some article you read about some lady who had had so many surgeries and procedures done and she was like literally 670s and she said that she wished that she had a twin hadn't had any procedures done so she could see at that point in time what she would what her real self would look like yeah i mean we won't throw out names of people because we don't want to put anyone down but there are people that are very much in the spotlight that you know get thrown on magazines or on social media because they just have like one too many procedures done and it starts to have like a reverse effect it starts to almost look a little frightening like unnatural but there's also like not even from the christian worldview there's a whole movement of women who have had breast implants and have experienced tons of health issues as a result of just stuff going wrong with that autoimmune issues things like that and they actually you know there's been kind of a movement of women removing the breast implants and just saying hey let's embrace the body that we have not like i said not from a christian perspective so it's interesting how there is like you know these movements that come and go and you know i heard of moms even like encouraging their daughter be like hey you should you know for your birthday for graduation gifts you can get breast implants but it's like outside of just the moral question of like is this right or wrong it's like there's also health. Things that now that we have enough years behind us like that we need to consider too which i think is. That's a little frightening is a statistic that our researcher molly our team member came across she's such an amazing researcher but it came from real self so a website which is all about cosmetic surgery news and they reported that more than eight and ten women so 84 percent of women in the us are unaware that a medical professional who performs surgical cosmetic procedures does not have to be bored certified and plastic surgery and i find that frightening because you're giving you know so if it's something like botox lip fillers i can see how that might not be like the ramifications actually know there have been some horror stories about actually and the fillers going wrong and i think what this is revealing is that there's such a demand and that there are so many professionals who are performing these surgeries performing these cosmetic routines on people these procedures and so many of them are most the majority of them. Are not certified and plastic surgery which means that there are probably a lot of people out there who got work done who aren't they look in the mirror and they think this is not at all what i thought this was going to look like botched or just slightly botched or feel like that's moving around in their face right or yeah botox shots that didn't land in the right spot so now you're numbing places and you just can't even naturally communicate because you feel like your face is you know can't express itself like there so there's real things to think about too of like the ramifications of things going wrong the outcome of that but that's that's a little more surface see but it's just like the health stuff too like there's a lot of things to kill and okay let's jump into like as christians really focus on that because. Anyone is welcome to come and listen to the girl to find podcast but we are definitely coming from a christian worldview we go back to scripture we you know that's where we're going to know what is god have to say about this and so i think it's really interesting john piper a very just respected christian leader who's been. He has some interesting things to say i know he did out to me about this whole idea of us chasing after youthfulness and striving to stay young striving to just be perfect no sad no bags no wrinkles i mean that's really the point of all this right and he had to say agent christians don't stay beautiful and strong in this life but they do become beautiful and strong in the resurrection the implication is don't pour your time and energy and resources into artificial aging inhibitors. Pour them into aging with holiness and grace because of god's grace aging is not only a witness to the fall it is also now a witness to the power of god's grace for those who trust him god has turned deterioration in to dignity and it's just kind of this reminder like the fall happened and that's when death came into the scene you know which ultimately set in motion us needing a savior in christ coming and. Death is actually a gift like aging and growing old is actually a gift and it sounds so bizarre but if we were to live forever we would live forever in an imperfect state apart from christ ultimately not with him in heaven and none of us. Forever and ever and ever to go on in this life like this with this these imperfections with the bodily struggles that we have with the injuries with the dysfunction i mean that would be a nightmare but god created i mean like death came into motion so that way one day we could you know. Be with him in paradise be with him face-to-face and everything to be restored and so it's we don't like to think about death we don't like to think about aging but if you think about it i know how old are not only are you that much closer to being with christ but your age represents the the sanctification that's been happening the depth of that like the life that you've been given their so much more to it so i think it's christians we need to take a step back and even realize like wow there's a lot more about aging and about death and about our life then just trying to look young know that youthfulness it is so idolized like to be useful and he also jumper talked about how our culture is youth dominated so like if you look at the like the hollywood scene you'll get nashville like the music industry the movie industry social media social media influencers like all of these people for the most part like the majority of them are young youthful people and so you is idolized like those are the ones who have the stages those are the ones who often times have the platforms and so there is this earthly temporal like we're forgetting that we're just passing through this isn't our home is christians we know we're ambassadors we're heading toward our true home this is just like an in between and we're not here just for nothing like as believers we know we're here on a mission for god and so for those of us who like can remind our hearts of that heavenly mission of building god's kingdom making disciples sharing the gospel being the handsome feet of jesus pouring out for others then as we age and get older and i'm like preaching to myself here more than anyone is just to see that he like john piper talks about aging is a beautiful thing it is those lines are a sign that god is giving us a long life a long life to serve him a long life to serve others to make an impact for the kingdom to share the gospel with lost people like that is a gift to have a long life not something that we should try to cover up something we should hide something we should be ashamed of but this youth dominated culture shouts the opposite message and so in order to have a clear mind really a gospel centered what really matters eternally focused mind we really do have to step away from the noise from the social media from the movie magazines and just really evaluate our hearts and say what is shaping and forming my view of my body of my beauty when i look in the mirror what is fuel in these things and i think for most of us and i'm guilty of this so many times it's coming from culture it's coming from my flesh it's coming from this desire to stay useful because somehow that's better and i'm forgetting all of these truths about eternity and what really matters i love first corinthians 6:19 through 20 which goes wrong with what you're saying it says or do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit within you. Whom you have from god you are not your own you were bought with a price so glorify god in your body our body is matter i mean that jesus death and resurrection wouldn't have been possible without his body you know so great we are called though to remember like you are not your own you are bought with a price you were bought with christ's body like so that one day yours could be ultimately restored and perfected with him in heaven and i just love that like okay do i think of myself as my own do i have this like entitled this mindset that is very much if you're not a christian that makes sense you know but it's like no we were bought with the christ we were adopted into god's family we are to have strong healthy bodies not for our own glory not to be like oh my goodness look how awesome i am but to point others to serve our families to serve in our churches to live well for the glory of god and if that truly is the driving factor of why we do what we do and our purpose and our mission here on life. It changes the decisions we make it changes what we do to ourselves it changes why we you know live each day the way that we. What she had to say about this so she was actually struggling going through cancer and really struggling with her appearance and she said botox and fillers and peels are like are the light oh and the light are not inherently moral issues and so and i agree with that and like you agree like we can't just set botox on the table and say is it in is it not there's so much more to it and it comes to our motives and i'm going to talk about that in just a second but she says they're not inherently moral issues i'm not writing this article this is calling talking to convince you never to use them she said but for me they present three intrinsic problems by altering my face to perpetually erase signs in my true age i'm communicating one i am not grateful for every year i've been giving here i'd like to pretend i've only lived 30 years and said a 47. And so for her like yeah and that's where i'm going to be pretty soon like trying to pretend like i'm a lot younger than i really am. I like why are we trying to pretend why aren't we just like she's saying why am i can't i not just be content with the age that god has given me number two she said i'm willing to prioritize feeling better about myself at the expense of caring for the people around me so that could be different for each of us maybe the time it takes to pursue some of these things the expense you know i'm shocked at some of the prices on some of these like skincare creams i'm like. Where is our priority and we can only do so much so our other things suffering at the expense of us pursuing personal beauty goals and then the last thing she said is this life. This moment is all that matters that's what trying to alter and change and like strive after perpetual youthfulness she said is the struggle in her heart is that it communicates to her and those around with this life this moment looking beautiful right now looking at right now is all that matters so just some insightful things that i thought colleen shared and what i love you maybe you were going to get to what julie's lottery shared oh okay you go for it but kind of turning the question on like what we mentioned at the very beginning like okay well if it's not if it's not sinful in and of itself if it's not wrong for some of us to like to get highlights or like right now you know if you're watching on instagram or youtube weren't wearing mascara we have foundation on like we have blush like we did things we called our hair we brushed our hair we do things to make ourselves look beautiful i mean quite frankly so. Where's the balance for us as christians and i love what julie says about this and i do want to recommend grill define god's radical design for beauty femininity and identity it's our book you can go to girl to find out comma just find it on amazon that book will get to the heart of all of this if you want to take a deep dive grab a copy of girl to find but i think this is a great place to end really yeah julie's words she says only god knows the motive of our hearts he discerns the secret fears and desires that fuel our decisions but sometimes we are not as honest with ourselves have you asked him to search your heart to show you what it looks like to honor him with your body if the bottom line issue is pride or fear are you willing to yield that to the lord and trust him with it and then just three questions to consider and i think this is what we want you to think about as you leave this podcast because like we said this isn't a you know black and white issue the bible doesn't speak to these things specifically but we are called like to use our bodies to glorify him to walk and wisdom and so she says. Julie sl. Is it wise these procedures whatever it is you're thinking about is it wise is it a wise use of our money is it a wise use of your money. And is it a wise choice for you. Physically. I think that's a really. Yes thank you guys for having this conversation with us we would love to continue it we know we could only scratch the surface we have a lot to learn we all have a lot to learn about this but god's word has a lot to say so we don't have to fret we can go to his word we can find wisdom and truth come hang out with us over on instagram at girl defined and if you appreciated this conversation please give us a five-star review spotify apple let us know you appreciate the show what kind of guest you want to have on other topics you want to cover and then come join us next week as we have another awesome episode of the girl to find show.
