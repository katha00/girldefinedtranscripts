Personal pronouns now i was on instagram the other day and this notification popped up asking me to insert my personal pronouns that is something new on instagram i had never seen it and i noticed a lot of people are putting their personal pronouns on there and a lot of christians but i opted not to put my personal pronouns and then over on our girl to find account we opted to not put our personal pronouns either and i know for some of you you're thinking yeah of course by would you and others are like well why not you however you define yourself just put that on there today we are going to dig into this very controversial but very relevant topic because we as christians we need to engage in this conversation we need to think about we need to think biblically about this what is god's design why are we four are not for putting our personal pronouns on their let's have this conversation right now what's up y'all it's bethany and kristen here and we're just going to go for it and. Listen to on here but here goes but i remember it was really interesting i don't know if you heard the podcast it was someone saying how they were talking about demi lovato and they were saying like i don't want to use the pronouns that she shares that they then because they're like that just robotically and all over doesn't make any sense but they were basically saying like they i guess youtube and i don't know podcast and everyone have basically made a statement like if you do not use the pronounce that people have declared for themselves so if they say they are they that whatever then we will literally take you off and so on this life podcast they were like i don't want to do this they were just super strategic to just a lot like and demi lovato and demi and demi rather than saying. The pronouns and so it's really interesting because even as we are talking about this. It's kind of scary like oh wait are we you know like there's a real chance that you can. We have to like we have to talk about this if we as christian women aren't going to have a candid and open conversation regardless of the risks regardless of the potential. Notification pop up on my instagram you know i had mixed feelings that first it was like. I kind of got me thinking like well really what would be the harm of putting in my what i'm viewing as my god-given pronouns okay i'm a female and i know god made me feel so okay if i put her is that really a big deal you know kind of got me thinking a little bit on that track and then it also at the same time and that same moment got me thinking on the other track that this idea of the she her him he they them whatever i know i'm probably missing a lot because it just like they keep expanding and keep getting more confusing i've heard of some really interesting ones where people are even referring to themselves as a certain animals and stuff like as their pronouns and so you know where is this going to end but it really got me thinking that this truly is. It's a battlefront and not just something that were against but it's for us fighting for something that we are so for and that is the truth of god's design and even though this might seem like a small thing and i have seen some christians that i know and love i have seen them put their pronouns on their instagram and you know i know i know these people that i know they're probably just doing it like yeah i'm declaring who god made me to be but at the end of the day i think there's i don't know if that's the best idea because in some ways it's like we are firing this idea that we can declare our personal pronouns like it's a normal thing to do yeah i mean it's really hard because i listen and you know read and in places where i feel like okay no i understand that i don't have the authority to name myself but i feel like and you may as well listen to be like i am in school or in college or in a workplace where i feel like very isolated and very much. A lot of pressure to start communicating and accepting. This massive narrative that the culture is pushing our way and i need some support and so that's why we're talking about this because we know you need support we need to be reminded of this truth and we want you to know like you're not alone that's the entire purpose of girl to find ministries is to link arms exactly where you are and say hey let's go towards christ because of christ in god's word is in our truth what do we have to stand on and you know it's interesting we just wrote a book and it released recently called not part of the plan trusting god with the twists and turns of your story and. I don't want to be a part of this or i i want i don't want to have to raise kids in this world like that can be a twist and turn and it can make us fearful and afraid and we need to learn to trust god is god bigger than this is their hope for the future is there a reason to not be filled with worry and anxiety like there's so much of that going around if if we don't have god if we don't have hope. What do we have and so we bring that to you we bring those scriptures to you and unpack them in our new book not part of the plan trusting god with the twists and turns of your story what are whether it's stuff and culture that's outside of your control or maybe it's a family member where you're like wow they've taken a path you know they've gotten caught up in all this gender stuff or maybe it's you personally conflicted and you're like i need some truth i need to know that there is a god that isn't changing i need to get to know his character i need to learn how to surrender better because i'm really struggling to want to control and to find myself. Not part of the plan trusting god with twists and turns of your story is going to be so crucial for you in this journey so you can grab it wherever books are sold you can grab the e version you know paperback whatever you can go to girl to find.com trust. Girl define.com trust or whatever books are sold i really encourage you to grab that cuz i think it's foundational as we have this conversation. Personal pronouns i am so glad you're joining us for this conversation please stick with us until the end and you know even as we get started you might be thinking okay like really what's the big deal is this really important to address so i think we should start there because unless you feel like this is a big deal and maybe you do maybe you're like yes i feel like this is such a big deal thank you for talking about it or maybe you're like. So as we start this conversation i think we should talk about like why it's a big deal and i think as christians it can be so easy because i fall into this to where we lose sight of god's bigger purpose and intent for creating humans like we're just starting out like why in the world did god create adam and eve and genesis what was he doing is that important is that significant does it speak to something bigger and so this question of well should we even care about personal pronouns. We as christians have to go much deeper and say ok google does god care about it does god care about male does god care about female does god care about gender does god care about sexuality does god have a plan and purpose and all of this is there something bigger that god is after and if so i need to care about it as a christian woman to i need to dig into this i need to understand this and as the two of us have grown in our understanding of god's design as we've been forced to research through books that we've ridden where we thought very inadequate like our the book that we wrote before not part of the plan actually before a devotional shine bright oh yeah it's a book called sexy and the longings of a girl's heart discovering the beauty and freedom of god define sexuality and i am telling you right now so honestly i've said this before i did not want to write this book when we set out to start the conversation with our publisher on what this book was going to be about bethany and i both felt so passionate and so convicted i would say from the lord that we needed to write a book on the topic of god to find sexuality but i'm telling you my heels were dug in i was like i don't want to have to dig into. One the personal places of my own heart regarding sexuality of the ways i've struggled to ways i've been the ways i've wrestled with less like i don't really want to have to be so transparent to the world about the deepest darkest places of my heart and then secondly like this is such a controversial topic i really don't want to write on something that's going to be so divisive you know that that was that was those were my heels to again but as we walked this journey god really for me personally helped me to see like transparency and openness humility about her own struggles that is what gives us a bridge to other people because we're all sinners all need of a savior as we talked openly about our own struggles that gives us opportunity to have those conversations with our sister who are so struggling in to say hey let's link arms galatians 6 barrel one another's burdens were in this together let's strive toward truth. Battlefront regarding sexuality as i learned more in studying for this book about god's bigger. Plan for for sexuality for gender it's like my eyes kept getting open wider and wider and wider until i was like we cannot write on anything else we have to write on this because this is a topic that personally i feel like our entire understanding of god of the gospel the purpose for our entire lives our existence eternity it hinges on so much of it hinges on us understanding gender and sexual identity properly from a biblical lens so yes personal pronouns it is so important. And we're going to get into work i mean i think when i. Why do i want to do this. I think that it's really hard because you know the bible talks about like how we are ambassadors for christ we're here this isn't our permanent like this isn't our permanent existence in this state forever like one day every knee will bow one day we will realize like wow just like god created the perfect garden to walk with him for him to be our king our god our father like. We will be in that place as his sons and daughters once again but we're not there right now and so it's really hard because the world is going to do the world like they're going to constantly be pushing and changing and you know we live by a different standard though we live by a different truth we live by the truth but we can't expect everyone else too so you can't be like okay well i understand i'm not going to do my pronouns but look at everyone else it's like no we need to each look internally and say okay am i going to follow god am i going to seek to understand truth for myself we can't force other people to change but in your workplace in your school in your family. You can understand truth and you can start to learn and gross that you can be a light not for your own glory but for god's glory and this is a crucial area because. Gender or even our physical design or physical bodies marriage this matter so much why would god have created it why would he put it in scripture why would he create male and female if it didn't matter and so as you come to understand. The bigger picture for even. Gender in marriage and you know all of that today i hope that it changes the way that you view this conversation about pronouns and i hope that it enables you to become a light just like we talk all about in our devotional shine bright so that you can glorify god in this area and not just go along with. The flow one of the biggest questions that i think all of us every single one of us are asking whether you are liberal conservative or christian and atheist like regardless of where you land on your beliefs i think every single one of us because by god's design i think we're asking this question. Who am i. We have god's word and so we asked that question who am i and if we're looking to god's word for the answer we can see so clearly who we are according to god's design and so we start to recognize okay. The the deciding of who i am scripture. Is actually up to god to decide who i am he informs me of who i am and then i have a choice to make i can either receive that identity that god has given me and walk in that or i can reject that and make the choice to define myself to answer that question who am i and go on a journey to try to discover that if you want to dig more into this particular topic about asking the question who am i specifically about identity go check out episode 53 right here on the girl to find show it was just a few episodes ago we dig into five biblical truth that define your identity and that episode is one where if you were wrestling with maybe finding your identity in all sorts of other things like maybe sports your career season of life maybe your failures maybe you're successes maybe it's race maybe it's gender it's sexuality whatever it is if you're like i know as a christian i'm not really finding my identity in christ even though i say i am i know i'm not in my heart go listen to that episode you're going to be really encouraged by it but back to that question. Who am i i think that we all are asking that and the answer has to come from somewhere right like everybody wants to know who they are we want to feel like we have a place of belonging we want to feel like we have a sense of purpose we have community we have connections and the place we go to find the answer to that question is ultimately going to be the thing that defines who we are that we view as the authority for defining who we are and whether we look to culture whether we look inside our own hearts our own minds whether we look to our past experiences our childhood whether we look to god's word whether we look to the people around us and say like who do you think i am we take our cues from them. Where we go to find our identity to find find the answer to that question who am i that is going to be the thing that defines us and now here's the scary thing if we're finding our identity in things that shift and change and over time we are going to at one point in time maybe feel confident in who we are then as time goes on that is going to completely change and so as christians as we survey the landscape of our culture as we are immersed in the narrative of the day which is very very much about defining ourselves searching for our identity looking beyond or looking within figuring out who we are and then confidently declaring to the world saying this is who i am whether it's through personal pronouns whether it's through some other means of saying this is who this is how i define myself this is who i am and you will refer to me as the same right this is who i am and i'm telling you i'm informing you as christians we see that but we. We know that we did not create ourselves that we are not here on accident that our existence isn't random we know there is a creator there is a god in heaven our days are numbered are he knows the hairs on her head he placed us on this planet at the exact time he did with the plan with the purpose and he is our definer he is our creator. And as we jump back i think to the very first book in the entire bible the book of genesis which is easy to overlook right it's like oh genesis adam and eve the sweet story of the garden god made the world in six days rested on the 7th and it's like blah blah blah blah blah like i've heard that since i was in sunday school as a child or maybe it's new to me but yeah it's just seems so basic. This is truly the book like this chapter genesis 2 genesis 1 and 2 really i would say for the two of us like as we dug into this it kind of smacked us in the face in the best way of like. There is so much more truth packed into these. First two books of the entire bible that brings so much clarity so much information clears up so much confusion gives us so many answers about this simple but profound question who am i that if we as christians just took a pause and parked our chairs genesis 1 and 2 and took it at face value and actually. Really listened and observed what god was doing and then. Receive the truth that we are reading it would be profoundly life-changing for us and i just want to affirm like i know that there are. People on here like you you know maybe thinking like well i am a christian and i know that i feel a certain way i don't identify this way and i know god wouldn't make me this way if you didn't want me to live this out like the whole idea of my truth and all of that and we just want to say up front right now like god is not a confusion and i just want you to know like yes those feelings may be strong and you may feel like it's not feelings it's truly who i am but we just want you to know like okay then let's go to god's word what does god's word say and as tim keller says so wisely that you're truth identity isn't achieved its received so our hope right now is that as you're listening even if you're struggling internally that you would receive what god says because i think that's the answer that's the hope that's the truth and they may not be what you want it may not be how you feel and it may be hard but ultimately that's what's going to set you free because the truth sets us free so. What does it teach me who does it say i am and then go from there that has to be your starting place that has to be what changes you that has to be what changes. Let's dig into. But like you were just saying we have to remember that god is love he is nothing other than love but god is also true he's one of 100% truth and 100% love and so if god is saying something in his word that conflicts with how we feel and we're tempted to view god's character through the lens of our feelings and think while if god saying that he must not be a loving god know what we have to do is remember god is 100% love god has 100% truth and so if he's telling me this in scripture even though it's contrary to what i feel i have to take it at face value and trust and believe that god is telling me this because he loves me. Because he loves me he is telling me truth cuz like bethany said the truth is what will set you free god would not be a loving god if he told us lies that affirmed our feelings. God would not be a loving god if he told us lies that are from our feelings god is a god of love and truth and he tells us the truth to affirm what is right and good so that we can walk in the light and not in darkness so that we can walk in truth and find freedom truly ultimately in our relationship with him and so yes that was such a good point and i think something that we have to remember and hold on to. Episode so we got a lot of stuff so make sure to go back and listen to get caught up to. I'm going to start in verse like okay i'm going to start in verse 26 just reading and i want you whatever you're doing just do what you're doing but try to listen and really soak up these words and i want you to maybe in some ways erase your preconceived ideas or what you think you know about genesis and try to receive the word with a fresh perspective of what was god up to like i said your agenda aside set your beliefs your perspectives aside and just try to receive the word what was god doing here in genesis so just contacts before we get to verse 26 god just finished making the whole world. That alone should remind us before we even get to the creation of the man and the woman. We're talking about a god who makes the world a god who creates every animal every mountain every stream creates the rain every part of physics and science in biology god knew it all he invented everything so right now as we dig into this we should have the heart posture of job which is like in awe of god's incredible goodness and power and the creator of the world we should be humbled as we approach the word who are we to tell god what to do he just created the entire world right okay so now we're all in our place let's check out verse 26 so after god created all the animals the creeping things and god saw that it was good verse 26 it says then god said let us so plural right there talking about the trinity god god she's in the holy spirit let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the heaven and over the livestock over all of the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. So god created man. In his own image in the image of god he created him male and female he created them. God just spent 5 days creating all sorts of things for the world and then he says let us make man in our image and so what does this mean this this idea that we as humans as specifically male and female as pointed out in scripture. Very specifically god is saying i am making something different than animals i'm making something different than trees i'm making something different than the rain and the sky and the mountains i am making humans that are unique and different than all other creatures because they are the only creatures that are made in my image after my likeness and so here we see something very set apart you know we also live in a society where we're told that people and animals are kind of all the same and it's just a spectrum but no god created man and woman specifically to be created after his likeness in his image and so that's amazing that tells us profound things and then in verse 27 god didn't just create being's right like genderless beings where it's just like a human being like just a genderless thing where it's you know all interchangeable know god specifically in verse 27 says so god created man in his own image in the image of god he created. Him male and female he created them. But i think that is a profound marker in scripture in the very first chapter of the entire bible where we see god having a blank slate he could have created anything he wanted imagine a black chalkboard there's nothing on it god could have done whatever he wanted. But what did he do. He chose in that moment to create a. Testosterone all of the chromosomes like he's a man and then he chose to create a female a counterpart to the man different but equal in worth and value but different and that's where we have to camp like okay god created two genders and i think that in our conversation with professor piercy without we had you know several weeks ago she has a book called love they body love thy body which i strongly recommend reading it's absolutely amazing and i think exactly what we're getting to the you know. Where did adam come from where did eve come from their physical bodies i think as we get into that. The simple basics are so telling exactly what you're saying like let's not fly over this and be like okay blah blah blah and then sunday school forget that i need something deeper like like we said god is not a god of confusion he has given us such simple clarity so as you look you can say what has god created me to be like has he given me the body of the female okay that is so telling he made man male and female that is so telling of. You know my pronouns you know that's so telling of my identity of who i am who i am and what i should live as you know and whether that goes along with how i feel or not like god is a god of love and he did not make a mistake and making you and giving you the body of a woman and that should tell you so much about internally. Who you are so i think this is beautiful news it's not discouraging it's not depressing this is wonderful. Or should we go into genesis 2:30 about male and female as we look at society as we may wrestle in our own hearts with you know i i was born with a body of a female but i feel more like a male. We cannot just take cues from a physical body but we can take our identity truly from the physical body in so many ways because like professor piercy said we want to split it so there's like a there's like your body and then there's like your personhood or what is your mind your mind and your body and almost like the body has been discarded as like an accessory like it doesn't matter it's just extra but who i think i am in my mind who i feel i am that is my true identity that is really who i am and if you're wrestling with that like we we get that that's so hard to be in that place and we're not diminishing that those struggles are very real for so many that is a really hard place to be but rather than looking to culture and saying okay well i'm struggling with who i am so i need to go discover that and figure it out god's word is pointing to genesis 1 and saying you don't need to go figure it out god has given you the body of a woman you are a female and within your female body which speaks to so much of who you are within that design god is giving you purpose as a female he's giving you instructions in his word as a female he's giving you a calling us a female he's calling you to glorify him as a female and even though you may not feel like that's right in this moment or maybe someone you know and you're struggling with what to affirm how to have this conversation like that's a conversation for another day truly but you can confidently know that the body the physical body is not separate from your identity it is intertwined it is a foundational part of who you are because in the beginning god created male and female and every person created since then god has had a purpose and a plan for and so was the two of us stand here today in the body is a female that is not insignificant to us that is massive 2 west that is an identifier for a forest that is informing us that is god telling us. He created us to be female on purpose and for a good purpose is super interesting and our books period they say everything for you so you don't have to feel awkward like i don't want to ask that question but this is crucial for this moment and so as we're talking about the fact that sexual identity is a god a signed reality as we see just in this very first place in scripture i know we unpack that more so you i think you had a conversation with rosario about her feelings that episode was amazing all of these episodes that directly relate to this topic below so you can find them but. We share the story about jackie hill perry would you may have heard of her book gay girl good god and we share her whole story and i'll just you know we're not going to have that but yes she grew up feeling feelings of attraction towards women was in a lesbian relationship ultimately came face-to-face with the gospel and it absolutely transformed her and she allowed the simple truth of the gospel the simple truths of genesis to change her life and to say hey like this should inform who i am and it's really interesting because they this is what happened we say our book is jackie hill perry came face-to-face with the gospel she was confronted with a challenge and personal question and this is what i want you to ask yourself okay this is the question. Who has the authority to decide once identity. Is it me or is it god and really interesting in an article. Is gender set by a preference of the individual or buy a providence of god or to put it another way is my sex determined by my decision in my mind or by god's design in my nature. Those are such telling questions and i think when we look to society to answer those hot button questions we're passionately told to fulfill our own desires we're told to follow our hearts and be true to ourselves. And christopher asmus a pastor who has a testimony similar to jackie hill perry he says the overarching sexual ethic of our day is i feel. Therefore i am. He says that i feel therefore i am human autonomy reigns supreme he says although this sounds somewhat compelling and freeing it leaves. Leads us to find our identity in our sexual desires. Rather than in christ this is like literally exactly what we're talking about y'all. Become the gods in our lives as a result we end up labeling ourselves with identities god never gave to us and i know like feelings and desires can be tricky things though like. Of course going against something that feels so right can often seem so counter-intuitive and so i just like as we are facing all of this it's like it really comes down to that like okay or feelings or god's design in our nature like it tells so much and it's so freaking as jackie hill perry song freedom as rosaria butterfield she was also in a lesbian relationship as she found freedom as christopher ausmus found freedom they're so much freedom that can be found and it doesn't mean like oh well i'm automatically going to feel a different way i'm going to okay that means i have to be in a relationship with a man like no it doesn't mean that your life may look exactly like every other christians but it does mean that you have freedom to embrace the body that god gave you it means you will have freedom to know as a woman i should not be in a relationship with another woman i should not be in a lesbian relationship i know i don't have to identify as they that i don't like i shouldn't i identify as a he him because god's word has made it so clearly that's where they're such freedom. Clearing up so much of the confusion that that humanity has wrestled with from the beginning of time since then entered the world in genesis 32 we see a zoomed i would say it's like a bird's eye view in genesis 1 and then god zooms in in genesis 2 to really show us more specific details of his creation of the man and the woman which i think is really amazing something else we can brush over because we read in a genesis one which is which is what i was reading from before but then when you flip over to genesis 2 you see this zoomed in picture where god's like okay you got the big picture right of what i did here with the man and the woman but i'm going to zoom in and give you some details i'm gonna give you some details of the order of how i created things and as you read genesis 2 which i encourage you to do on your own after you listen to this maybe your next quiet time just camp in genesis 1 and 2 and ask the lord to show you what he was doing his word that maybe you've never really seen you've never really soaked in before and as you so i'm not going to read all of genesis 2 for the sake of time but as you look in genesis 2 you see this more detail picture of the man and the woman you have this question answered of okay i am created specifically by god with a specific gender by god's design in genesis there are only two genders there are three there are five they're on to 100 gender identity becomes something where there is all sorts of options available to us now to identify as we see in god's word. There are only two. God's word makes it plain and clear it's not complicated yes it may feel complicated but according to god's word it's not complicated it's very straightforward there is a male and there is a female by god's design and before we get stuck on just thinking okay great well i i see my design as a woman i want to embrace that we can get stuck on us and thinking that it's about us and thinking about that our gender which so much of our society is narrative it's all about who you are and your life and your whole purpose and your everything you're worth it's all centered on you and god doesn't leave us there he says this is my design but it's for a bigger purpose you are designed as a female isn't random it's not an accident because it's pointing to something much bigger and male you two men something much bigger is going on here and as we see in genesis 2 we get a glimpse of this that adam created sorry god created adam first so that's very interesting he created the man and before the woman was ever on the scene god was giving the man job responsibilities rolls right he's like he created him outside of the garden brought adam into the garden and that's very interesting said this is your home he brought all the animals to adam is working adam is learning how to be a good. Caregiver i mean literally he's given instructions by god that he's not he's like okay great i got it but adam doesn't know what's about to happen he doesn't know a woman's about to hit the scene so adam's doing all of this with god walking with god. As many commentators think preparing adam to be the husband provider the leader the the caregiver the lover for his wife that he would need to be god was preparing him for that. Then after god i guess feels like adam is ready i'm not sure i wasn't there we see in genesis 2 that god creates the woman from the man. So interesting you'll know the story took a rib out of adam formed the woman from the man and then in verse 23 chapter 2 adam literally declares this at last is one of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man and i can only imagine adams excitement after naming all the animals and he's seeing like male female male female male hi mrs giraffe oh hi mrs elephant monkey. All right everyone seems to have a pair but me so i'm sure he was taking note of that and then that person 23 i think is a beautiful declaration of adam saying at last there is someone who is my partner someone who is my companion someone who is like me for me i mean that must have been such a beautiful moment in the garden like i just i wish i could have seen it. Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother so there we see again gender father and mother very clearly god is already defining what a family is what marriage is in genesis 2. A man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to who. Hold fast to his wife. A picture of marriage a man and a woman in a family with a father and mother there's so much in this one little verse that we we need to pay attention to and say god is teaching us he is informing us here verse 25 and the man and his wife were both naked and we're not ashamed. And then it goes into chapter 3 verse and enters the world and everything gets confused and distorted and polluted and that's where we are today still wrestling with the sin and our own sinful struggles and tendencies but as we zoom ahead and i mean you can probably jump into this like the idea that god created man and woman and we see in genesis to. 4 marriage he created them to be coming from a family which is so interesting that he said that and adam and eve were the first humans and he's like god was setting us up for future patterns of a man leaving his father and mother right male and female. Becoming one flesh what does that mean sexual intimacy so already we see so much going on here i just want to say it just because god created marriage doesn't mean that every person right i'll get married and you know sometimes. I wasn't fulfilling god. Planet purpose of glorifying him in a living for him know but it also didn't mean that i looked down on or you know was like oh well then that's a bad design i don't like that because it's not happening for me or chose to rebel against it i celebrated it i am i rejoice in it for others and i promoted it even if it wasn't the exact season that i was in and i think it's exactly like you said kristen that. When we are humble and we pray for humility and we seek to be authentic image bearers and we say god this is about you and telling the true story of what you have created and it becomes and who you are it becomes a lot easier we actually. I'm really unpack this idea of a marriage and all of what that truly reflects in our book love to find so if you're wanting to take a deep dive go there but marriage think about it as lovely as it is it is only a picture of something greater okay so get this marriage is an earthly representation of something much grander god placed the institution of marriage on the wall of this world as a representation of the gospel. Ephesians 5:31 through 32 says therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh this mystery is profound and i'm saying that it refers to christ and the church. God's greatest purpose for creating marriage isn't about you it's not about me it's not about just what it does to us but it's to show the world. An earthly representation of christ covenant what christ covenant relationship looks like with his church christ is the groom and the church is his bride and so ultimately that is just like a super big flyover but ultimately marriage it's not about us yes god is so gracious to give us a pleasure and companionship and joy and offspring and all of these things that can come from marriage but ultimately marriage is about something so much greater and it's ultimately a reflection of the gospel we don't have time to take a deep dive into that right now but when you start to look and you start hunting pack. What's missing when we start to try to redefine things on our own we see how we are literally like. I guess the destroying the very nature of what god created were destroying the fact that this is all ultimately supposed to point to him this isn't about us and i think that's when we you know when we start to define ourselves and we try to name ourselves it becomes about us and ultimately we weren't created with the capacity to find joy and to find happiness and to find identity within ourselves so it's a never-ending road and that's why it's always changing pronouns identity you always are on it's a journey because. I'm finally fully happy no. You know oftentimes it just brings more confusion more struggle there may be happiness for a moment but y'all this is also knew i mean. I don't even know what the long-term damaging effects especially with all of these you know surgeries when it comes to even like ultimately like transitioning our bodies real we're not down the road like we don't even know the harm that this is doing long-term but we know it's not for our best when it completely rejects our creator so this is a topic to take very very seriously don't take this lightly i know it's hard when there are people we know and love ourselves are going through something but that's what you have to equip your mind with truth and the worst thing that we can do is to just be like well there are hands up in the air and be like oh well you know the best thing we can do is to dig into truth to be a voice of truth and way and to not give in and and be afraid because we might get canceled or we might be you know like remove from someone's life. Truth with love and just you know equipping ourselves so we can we can speak in a way that is. I guess like makes sense and is biblically based i feel like that's crucial in this conversation and as we kind of circle back to our initial the initial topic i guess of this whole chat which is the idea of pronouns like as christians should be embrace it should be not i hope it's becoming more clear like it's not just about oh yes or no but it's so much more it's about fighting for god's original intended design by creating us as male or female on purpose for the bigger picture of pointing back to him and glorifying him and something so beautiful that we see in scripture is this idea of a covenant it's not a word we use in our everyday language right i'm not talking about like oh my covenant with god or whatever but god uses this idea of a covenant and what does a covenant it's essentially a promise so strong. That it cannot be broken and our modern day and age we think of things more as contractual agreements right we think about what marriage is kind of like a contract but god is saying there's something so much bigger at play he created marriage to be an earthly like bethany said an earthly reflection of this covenant love that a covenant keeping god has with his children and we see this picture of covenant throughout the old testament of god making covenant with the children of israel and saying basically i will never leave you i will never forsake you i am making a promise so strong that it will not be broken and that same covenant that idea of covenant god placed in the institution of marriage and is saying that marriage between a man and a woman each one representing a different aspect of god and the church right the man representing god the woman representing the church marriage isn't just a contract it's not just a get married to be happy get married to fulfill some some desire in your life it's like no marriage is a covenant that you're entering into and saying this this earthly institution to find and designed by god is meant to point back to the covenant keeping love that god has with his people with his children at a church should be so strong that it should be like a covenant a promise that can never be broken and that is just something that we lose sight of we don't realize the when we're getting male and female confused and gender it's like when we start to see there has to be one man and one woman in a marriage first of all. To portray the picture of christ in this church accurately without a male and a female we do not have an accurate picture of christ in the church that's the first starting place we get that accurate picture and then we see marriage is that covenant designed to point us back to the covenant keeping love of our heavenly father is tim kelly says it's so beautifully he says marriage is not a man-made institution primarily for man's benefit but rather a god made institution primarily for god's glory and that's why defining marriage according to god's terms is so crucially important because it displays an accurate picture of who god is and what the gospel means when two people unite of the same gender to men or women or these days for seeing three four i mean the options are really becoming endless what's happening is that they are not that institution it's not truly marriage is defined by god it's not telling an accurate picture of who god is and so not only do we get confused personally as we look on like okay what is this earthly picture it's it's not telling an accurate picture of god so then we get confused about who god is and then that's when it spirals really downhill and even as believers we start to question everything about god and his character in the bible and what's what and who's who and so starting with that foundation of genesis one two building on that into marriage between a man and a woman building on that into a covenant love and then ultimately recognizing that sexual intimacy. Is not something that god placed outside of marriage but within marriage as an additional way to affirm his covenant love with his people to say i love you so much that the same sort of intimacy you have in your covenant marriage is the same sort of relational and spiritual intimacy i want to have with my children that's what that points to as well so nothing's random i know this is such a fast flyover nothing's random it's all intentional gender matters what god created you to be is is informed and is is integrated into your physical body and then we as as people have to decide are we going to look to our creator to figure out our pronouns are we going to look to ourselves and we we want to challenge everyone every single one of you who's listening to say i want to be a woman who goes to god's word remember the god who created the entire world in six days the one who designed me is the one who defines me and i'm going to start with that foundation and i'm going to build from there on the truth of god's word and as we do that we will be freed up to one not being trapped in sin and lies and confusion which is what the enemy wants he wants to kill steal and destroy. Every human that is his goal and god wants to bring freedom and truth and wholeness into our lives and we can only find that as we conquer stand by the power of the cross as we look to god for our identity and walk in the truth of his word as we wrap up i just want to make it clear that like happiness is not the goal here because you might be like well i know two men who are in a relationship and they seem very happy like we all have the capacity to enjoy happiness and to have. Nice things in life and to even. That's not the point the point of life is to do god's will and glorify him i mean if jesus came for personal happiness he wouldn't have died on the cross but he said i came to do the will of my father i came to serve and not be served i came to glorify god and so his purpose for me. That sister has to be your goal it can't be like well i know i would be really happy with another woman that may be true you may feel like really in this moment in the season i feel really happy but ultimately what's your heart is your heart to live for god is your heart to do the will of your father he's put it in his word he's made it so clear so you have to ask yourself am i out to get my own happiness temporal and did you do things my way or am i out to live according to god's design and to glorify him and to just like all of those amazing what do you call analogies or. Living for you would be the most important. Think about me happiness is not the most important thing i mean missionaries for crying out loud that get like murdered and stuff like they have the perspective the eternal perspective that making jesus name known and pointing others to him is the most important thing like jesus himself said not my way yeah exactly be done and he was god saying that like wow there's so much more we can unpack we're going to have to land this plane real quick but like i said i'll link all of the other episodes below with professor piercing period. I need this truth but don't know about the girl to find show podcast please leave a review so that they can find it as well all right we're going to wrap this up and we will see you next week.
