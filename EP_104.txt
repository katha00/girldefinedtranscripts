Today i'm going to go to find show we are going to answer your questions about sex and now we actually took a deep dive into these questions and her books period and the longings of a girl's heart but we have received so many more since this book came out questions where you said i kind of want to know this about sex or i kind of want to know this about like my past or about the future but i don't really want to ask this you send these questions in the end and an email very anonymously and we are going to bring them to the forefront and says a lot of you are asking me to let's talk about we can talk about this as christian women this is a conversation that we are almost too excited to have like we're at the opposite of shy when it comes to talking about sex and it's a machine but we have come to understand. Regardless of where any of us have been what we've done what we are afraid of what's been done to us as we really understand the beauty of god's design for sex for intimacy for forgiveness for all of these things under nation past sin and failure versus god's redemption and walking a new passport in christ strength like there is so much beauty in his design that we do not have to be afraid about it and and scared to talk about it in fact about how to answer all of our questions and hopefully bring you some like biblical hope and help that you find so angry and we're really talking about god's design for sex and sexuality because you don't all the sudden become like a sexual being once you're married you are sexual being before that so how do you deal with that how do you grow up with that and we were talking about some of these questions and i was so encouraged by some of these women on this call who were opening up and sharing things in front of the group is very first time and you know the thing that stuck out to me the most was just. How we all come from different places in this area so we know that each one of you watching or listening has something different that you're bringing to the table and oftentimes it's something heavy is something difficult and we know that there are so many of you like you mentioned something that's been done to you that you did not want that you are like why did this have to happen and so. If you're listening on the podcast i'm going to link an article below by an incredibly godly woman who walked through the journey of healing from stuff that was done to her sexual abuse and if you are watching the video will link it as well because we want you to know that there is so much hope and encouragement and victory that can be had and. We we want to point you to like godly woman who have been there and who have offered their stories and their biblical advice cuz that's just something that we know with this amazing sisterhood that that might be present in this conversation so we just want to get that out there first and now we're going to jump into some of the questions yeah but i do want to say you did mention the book there's so much more that we are not going to cover in our question yesterday because we wrote all about it in her books period how do i find freedom. None of us are 100% whole in and of ourselves we all need the saving grace of jesus which is why he died on the cross and so we talked about through the lens of her sexual brokenness how we find that wholeness in christ how we disciple ourselves to understand the truth of god's word how it affects our lives in singleness and dating and engagement and i know in the same age sexuality even gender and we're just getting so far from the market scripture we go there in this book so if you want more than this little conversation grab a copy of dot it's on our shop and you will find so much. For the first half past question about sex that we're going to answer. If a girl is going to be single for her whole life does that mean she will never have sex at all and i know this is a huge question single women have like okay if i'm going to be a single forever like does this mean that i'm missing out on like the pinnacle of what it means to be a human and sex is kind of become a god in our society like christian like circles and secular because. If a girl is going to be single for her whole life does that mean she will never have sex at all i personally think we're kind of asking the wrong question cuz we don't need to determine or try to foresee into our entire future we don't know like we don't know if you're a single woman you don't know if you're going to be single for your whole life so why are you trying to figure out like you know playing for 30 years down the road when. I think that's something i want to say up front but the reality is that. Yes if god has you single for your entire life he is also called you to a life of abstaining from sexual intimacy and that is a part of his plan it is a part of his design it's for our best for his glory because god is the good designer of sexual intimacy and he created it. Within the covenant of merit and we take such a deep down in her books period on the purpose for intimacy like the purpose for sexual intimacy the purpose for that aspect of marriage like we really go there in our books period. But i just want you to know that. Because our savior jesus christ who was fully god and fully man literally came to this world with a single life like he was single he never had sex he never got married but he fulfilled the greatest purpose that could have ever been filled and his heart was one he came to do the will of his father so he wasn't here to do what he wanted to do he came to do god's will and he also came not to be served but to serve into ultimately give his life and that sounds like miserable like what you're telling me now he is the one who said hey google give us the ability to serve him well if we can trust i desire to experience this physical intimacy that you have created but i'm going to trust you today and then tomorrow i'm going to do the same thing and i'm not going to focus on well i like i have sex in the future i'm going to focus on living room for you today so another question that a lot of you have asked and we do talk about this in her book security and you have a girlfriend because i remember thinking that when i was unmarried as well have never had sex and you it's like when you're at the grocery list checking out and you're getting bombarded with like all these messages like the greatest thing that ever hit the planet because it is clearly like the greatest thing you know when you get on all these magazines all these words like all the things and here's the deal is awesome like our culture does have that right it is really amazing but when it comes down to it and designed by god to be enjoyed as a celebration within the covenant of marriage it is awesome but it is also something that couples have to work at yeah it's not just a boom it's going to be like this most like fireworks fourth of july like every single day in your marriage like it is something like anything in marriage it's pouring out when two people in america are genuinely loving one another and enjoying sexual intimacy as they serve each other for the mutual pleasure and enjoyment of one another it is really a beautiful thing and it can be for july but it's not like that all the time and i think that is one of the myths that. When you're single and you see the tabloids and you see those you know like rom-coms and it's just like this most explosive experience all the time that's not actually what it's like every single day and so i think that's where we need to kind of take it down and recognized it is a beautiful amazing gift it's a celebration but it's not for the july every single time and it is something that we do need to work at but it is such a beautiful bonding part of marriage and in fact i don't know if this is too much to share but someone gave us some advice and said you know it's not always for 4:50 house in the city and then sometimes it's just a little bit more medium like chili's you know what you're just kind of like okay it's kind of a medium like it's really nice but it's just a little bit more medium and then sometimes it's like mcdonald's it's just fast and it's like a little bit quicker more like a driver and i thought i should get in some ways of like okay you don't have to be disappointed in marriage is not always the state house like it's okay to have a variety and to enjoy different types of sexual intimacy with in your marriage and so i don't know if that's helpful and single miss but just recognizing obviously there's the entire book of song of solomon where it is praise is beautiful it is like poetry it is so romantic and that can be such a beautiful fun part of marriage and we both experienced that and are so grateful for that but just know that it is not the ultimate thing that can start by you were married and we know it's not the it's not the ultimate yeah that's fine that's if it was and every person would be satisfied and every person having sex with just be driving we know about not the case and so we know we were made for more and enjoy my contacts it really can be shot on something and i think if you are single or married really taking the time to take a step back and make sure that your views and your understanding of sex are in line with god and i mean that's why we wrote sex period single or married women because she go into marriage with wrong ideas wrong expectations wrong views and then we're just a solution to disappointment kids and we're like what in the world you know and we don't know where to turn or where to go to and so if you haven't like taking the time to intentionally study got design or even dig into maybe some of your past or or some of the things that you need to work through or you know whatever it is wherever you're coming from i think driving a copy of sex period that will be really helpful and just you know figuring out this project you want to pay for a married woman too there's an incredible podcast called kevin in your home. And it's specifically for christian married women and it is one of the most powerful podcast on like sex and intimacy and that's like all she covers and you know i know we have a lot of married women who are like well we've had complications or struggles and so like what like i haven't even experienced this fireworks that you're talking about that's extremely normal and extremely like common we just don't talk about it a lot so i just want to give you some hope by saying that there are resources out there that can really really help you i have found so much help in this podcast on youtube helpful okay another question about sex. What is allowed before marriage i mean obviously sex is reserved for marriage but how much is too much during. Dating now where's the checklist why didn't you just get a quick checklist i mean we were both there like we were we remember i remember just thinking like okay why didn't god make something so incredibly clear like clearly he says that they're you know like. Physically like sex coming together is reserved for marriage but why didn't she give us like a black and white noise like come on you know is touching on the shoulder ok. Like. Most of your marriage is like friendship yeah i mean we're sitting here recording right now and her husband are they're working it's like we're not you're not just talking to me like go in there and i constantly just hugging and kissing and so i think a single or engaged like. Constantly having conversations and thinking about the physical side you know we do have a freebie. For you if you are in the dating sites that will really help you to focus on things other than just how can we do so we have a guide 1356. The person and get to know the heart of the person that you are dating or engaged to and i really want to encourage you to work through that you can get it at google.com / questions for free because this is a way for you to focus on. Something other than just like how much can we do and i think you know putting your mental energy into a different place would be really helpful i feel like you probably have good things a little time i mean i think it can be helpful in the relationship to kind of decide like one thing we encouraged a young couple in recently was instead of making a list of all the things you can't do like we can't do this and we can't do that and you know there are a lot of those things where you're like you know i don't know if that's a very healthy line for us married why don't you make a list of all of the things that you believe that luckily are good for you as a couple like certain forms of affection certain ways that you are showing up to one another that you're both comfortable with that you both feel like are honoring one another respecting one another i'm not crossing any sexual lines where you feel like you're compromising one another and so make a list of the things that you can enjoy together so it's more positive than like your boundaries we will not do these funny things it's just kind of feels like and said here are the 10 things so we can enjoy with one another and you can be a specific as you want to be but i think it really helps focus on the things that you can enjoy together and this season of showing affection of dating but not yet married or you're still on the lord where you're still on one another because you are not spouses yet but they're still are ways that you don't really show affection so that would just be some encouragement down together brainstorm pray about it she cancel what what can we do. When we were dating and engaged i really appreciated how you know we came up we did come up with that like specific boundaries and i think that can be helpful but we also focused more on like building the friendship and really enjoying the freedom we have to get to know each other as friends like we got to know this amazing person and we didn't you know compromise our conscience and our convictions all along the way of course we weren't perfect but i can tell you all the relationships i've been in like i said i didn't get married so you know i have. I know you're not alone i know there are so many and in fact we have each had different sexual things that we wrestled with and in my singleness i share all about it in sex purity and the longings of a girl's heart wrestling with masturbation and trapped in that sin ongoing struggling wanting freedom you know not sure how to you know finally break free and then going on a journey where i actually did eventually find freedom and it was so encouraging but having to move past that and actually receive god's forgiveness and and go to him and genuine repentance and was going before the lord in genuine humble repentance and saying god i send you first and foremost god i am so sorry please forgive me and genuinely going beforehand you know there are so many beautiful songs is it from 34. Galatians 5:1 hold on to this promise it says for freedom christ has set us free stand firm therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery and so it is for freedom that christ has set us free that freedom that you long to walk in you can have that in christ as you play before the lord it doesn't mean you're never going to say again will always have some struggles before you know on this side of heaven but god is saying i have died so that you can walk in freedom so don't submit again to play don't just go right back into that thing you know set up accountability walk with godly mentors in the word grounded in your local church like do the thing to be safe but it starts with that repentance and then receiving god's forgiveness and accepting it but leaving it and then saying god help me to walk in the freedom that you have promised and me in christ and i want to read a quick question from our other book love to find which is all about god's design for lasting love and satisfying relationships and in it we actually wrote an appendix on the back of the book called finding freedom and forgiveness from past sexual sin. Regardless of your past yes god is greatly grieved by our sin and calls us to repentance but that does not change his ultimate love for us your worth is not defined by what you've done or what's been done to you. Your work is defined by god alone and because of him you have immeasurable value you have intrinsic important because you are made in god's very image and so every pursue forgiveness repentance freedom from that lens of having value and importance in the eyes of our creator i think that is so encouraging as we come before our father who cares for us who loves us and and wants to offer forgiveness and that freedom from our past sexual women the last question that we're going to answer the question. I was just asking recently a godly woman she was asking genuinely though and she wanted to know she's single and she asked will a godly man want to marry me if i have sinned sexually. In the past and if she was you know so genuine and just like you know i have done i know i've sinned against god and i chose to live in you know a season of life where i didn't honor him and i you know made choices actually that we're not in line with scripture and so i'm just struggling and wondering like okay i want to honor god now and i'm living differently now and i repented and i have accepted god's forgiveness but will a godly man. Want want to marry me and my heart was just so broken in the moment cuz i'm like we're all sexually broken like of course we all we all have been sexually every even the most godly of man out there you know like all of us have we are sexually broken beans and we all come to the foot of the cross equally across the board that we are broken and we need to savior and we need the gospel and we need christ forgiveness just as much as the next person and so. Doesn't have a good perspective of the gospel i mean i have. No we've known so many great christian you know where it's like the man or the woman one of them has the past and they have married each other and have built such a beautiful marriage and that was a conversation maybe things they had to work through but it wasn't the barrier or a reason to keep them from. Absolutely there are so many godly men. I want a woman who right now desires to follow god who desires to live for god and if that's who you are and that's where your heart is he is going to see that and i think you could build a beautiful relationship together in a beautiful future together.
