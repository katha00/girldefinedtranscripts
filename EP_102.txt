Today i'm going to go to find so we are talking about five things that christian women do not want now i know there are a lot of loud voices out their so-called speaking for all of us as women but we have heard from so many of you saying hey actually we don't want those things in fact we want the opposite we don't like what we're hearing on them you know seeing on the magazines hearing on pop radio like know that doesn't represent us as women so we are here to share some of the things that you also submitted and said actually we don't want facebook recipe. What do we not want to be defined by what are we not passionately chasing after that the world says we should be at least five things do not represent every woman out there but we feel like the loudest voices often come across as representing all of us as women when that's not true there are economists who think differently who actually hold to a lot of traditional values and who are actually like. And. Femininity and identity. It's radical like in this day and age to go back to god's design which is often those traditional values those values for family for marriage for what god's design is for gender for womanhood for distinctions for seeing the beauty in those things. So let's jump in what are the five things that christian women do not want okay i know this might like like. This is a quiet voice and we're bringing it out okay the first thing that christian women do not want is we do not want to be called birthing people we do not want to be called birthing people this was quite popular like in the in the instagram box where people were submitting women were submitting things we do not want and you kept saying things like that like we don't want to be called birthing people we don't want to be called people with a uterus we don't want to be called leaders you know things like that like of our physicals so we have bleeders society we have lost all capability of distinguishing young man from a woman because we are told and we talked about them past episodes that you know the culture says no and you know this and a man can be a woman a woman can be a man there's actually no distinction and so when you even try to define or ask someone who doesn't hold to god's word says about a man and a woman you say what is a woman. What is a man. So distorted so convoluted so confusing in this world of like we're trying to include everyone but when it comes to gender like there are very clear lines there are very clear distinctions that god is drawn that he has given us as our creator and so we have christian women cannot get confused and we know that we aren't confused and that's why i think many of us are frustrated today we don't want this we don't buy into this we don't believe that i am a woman yes i was born with these specific female parts and that is part of what does define me as a female and that's very special and very valuable when we talk about this in our book girl define that's radical design for beauty femininity and identity that the physical aspects point to something deeper about created an accident it's not a mistake god doesn't make mistakes like that and we might feel confused to sometimes and the world might help using messages but we can look and see what god had a good plan he made me a woman he gave me a uterus he gave me these functions that are specifically for female four women that men do not have and that's something beautiful and something give me celebrated and not something just say like well it doesn't really matter what your body parts are you get to decide you know what kind of the whole thing with like gender reveal things like oh no we don't want to do that because we want to wait until they decide yes they might have these certain body parts but know that doesn't really say anything about who they are and i think we need to take a step back and say okay god. Intentionally created the man and the woman he intentionally created them so uniquely different but so equally valuable and it's beautiful and it's amazing we have christian women need to uphold that and and be bold about that fact and not shy away and start to give in to some of this and i think i mean i am very much against using these modern terms i think they're extremely offensive to everyone and i think they only you know add to the confusion and they don't speak truth. And that is as christians we must speak truth in love which means we cannot buy into the confusion we cannot buy into the narrative we can't even buy into the language in so many ways we have to be willing to say what the world looks at and says that's unloving that's because that's hateful to call this man a woman or the reverse you know whatever he wants to be called if you choose to acknowledge the truth about his design as god created him then you're called all sorts of names and so we can't back down because we love you too much we love people too much to say we love you so much that we care about the truth about who god made you to be and so with compassion with love with grace we can step out of love for everyone and that is truly the most loving and compassionate thing to do is to speak the truth right so we don't care about this at all we have no opinions on it okay so that's the first thing that. Christian women do not want is that we don't want to spend. Are most fertile years chasing after a career. I know this one is going to get a lot of mixed feelings right now and you know this again it doesn't represent every christian woman but this does represent a lot of christian women and in fact again a lot of women who don't even believe in the bible you're saying you know what as we're learning more about our bodies more about our fertility as many of us are wrestling with infertility as we're learning more about our cycle or whatever you know what we have been buying into the slide that we should women spend our youngest most healthy most career and slaving away exhausted you know barely sleeping just crushing my body and then maybe hitting menopause and we're told that. By all means don't even think about kids cuz i will interrupt every possible career path that you're pursuing and many women have bought into this and now are backtracking and saying whoa whoa whoa i don't know if this is actually as good as it sounds and as we talked to many of you you feel the same way. Bringing truth to you that obviously takes time you have a lot of personal like business process it doesn't mean as women that we throw all of our passions that are outside of children out the window you know you look at the proverbs 31 woman a very ambitious very passionate very savvy business entrepreneur entrepreneurial woman but you see her values you see that she was able to pursue her family pursue her her husband her children like all of those things at the same time with these other things so i think there is a way a healthy background but there are many of us who don't want that just like that 955 many of us we genuinely want to take advantage of that period and episode 902 our careers and then he's going to on the french were like oh no let me think about having children and it's a cruel wake up for a lot of women and their their struggling and so go listen to episode 98 and then 99 was with a doctor who really went into a lot of the more medical side of things and just what you're saying like what are you talking about i didn't know how many of these people even i know a lot of people who listen to that episode do you say 99 yes on birth control the birth control pill specifically as you've learned about like oh your cycle and why it is often much harder for women in their latest it's not just random like there are physiological decline it's like our fertility is declining and like our eggs we are losing our account and until we hit menopause and we have none and then our fertility is zero and so it's like we're not realizing you know you hear people talk about like all the chicken clock and all this but it is actually reality it's not just a joke there is an end and many of us are realizing you know what it makes sense like having kids younger when you're more fertile when you have more energy like. Feminism really over the last i don't know how many decades well and it's not an accident that we were built this way and we were made this way i mean god is such a good designer such a good creator and he made us to be most fertile in her. Beautiful years and i'm just getting back to what i was like in my twenties as compared to now in my 30s and my energy does not look the same and i mean you might be able to tell i don't know how much i'm in video but i am like you know just like how many weeks pregnant at this point eight weeks away from getting birth i'm like i think if i was 24 i'd probably be feeling totally different i'm 34 and i you know that was god's plan for me i wanted to get married i wanted to have kids ultimately control these things like ultimately but yeah we do have choices that we can make and if we are intentionally putting that off and and say no like maybe we need to take a step back maybe we need to rethink this because it is something i think having children embracing motherhood it is something beautiful and i i love when i see some of these younger women actually you know if they have the opportunity to get married in to see them starting their families i just think you know really awesome. Okay i'll jump into the number three the third thing that christian women do not want and this came directly from one of you you said we don't want. Meant to stop being chivalrous amen sister. It's a beautiful complementarian. Junction and it's just sad that we've watched that i know many of us want that and we don't want to lose that and we acknowledge and realize that there are men and women who are just not kind and not in the very selfish and manipulative and all of that so we don't want that we're talking about men with genuine hard to aren't perfect but he's like. I appreciate it that i went on that were paid since are beautiful and if we embrace them and if a man is walking in his masculine strength in a humble kind way to serve others to love others i think jesus is the most perfect example of this right of like the the strongest human in the world maybe not like when he was human in the muscle sense of the word but like in every other capacity came the ultimate picture of that masculinity and when men are genuinely loving others with that kind of heart like why would we want to stop why would we want to smash that we don't we want to encourage that and call that out so. Let's go let's jump into the number for this one is a spicy so if you're spicy parameter is like i can't handle any more you might want to turn it off. Many of you said that we don't want someone else raising our kids. Okay straight off the bat i know that there are circumstances and situations where there are incredible single moms for providing and doing the very best that they actually can what we are talking about here and what many of you are emphasizing we don't want someone else raising our kids is this whole idea that. You need to be making a name for yourself and being a mom being like a stay-at-home mom like investing in your kids like oh we don't want that that's not something to chase after that's not something to pursue that's not something worthy like you need to do something better with your time and i know we hear this like well know we want every woman to do what she wants but how often are you hearing the role of motherhood and women who aren't just mothers who actually choose to invest into their children the best hours of their day with their children like pretty much it was so interesting i was listening to this interview the other day and it wasn't a christian interview totally secular but one of the ladies on was i can't remember who she was but she was like the movie or like media world i don't really know but she was really very very successful in the world's like according to the world scanners of 651 to have kids because she was so focused on climbing the lettering her career and she was sharing not even i don't even think she was a believer she was just saying to this day and i think at the time of the interview she's passed child like years she was saying that is one of her biggest regret and i think that is what so many of us who made by into the slide that like yes children aren't really worth much like it's not really that awesome they're hard they're expensive like and yes all of those things are true like motherhood just like you wake up and it's just dream world of like rainbows and butterflies everyday like it's not like that for you you know there are challenges and it can be hard but we know it's worth the investment it's worth the time and my heart just goes out to women who are past that she's looking back and saying man i think i really miss something because from that point you know maybe that career they fought for for so many years maybe all this stuff that they have maybe the world's applause just ringing a little empty as they come here maybe the value of a family so i mean that's been something the two of us have had to really just because like we said we've both desired children right very long time neither of us had children until our 30s you know i have my sunday junior about to have a little girl you have adopted to awesome boys and so we desired these things are they did not happen for us but it's been a shift because we have like you know not really by choice but we had a lot of time where we write just kind of confused on ourselves and our marriage and whatever we wanted and then you have kids and your whole world has turned upside down in the best way possible but we both have realized how much like our time we don't have unending time we can't be in two places at once until we've really had to like completely adjust the way that we run girls find we had to completely adjust our schedules and we actually did an episode all on motherhood a few back i don't have that number in front of me. You know all of that it can take a lot of sacrifice but it's so awesome to see that so many of you are desiring that and we just want to encourage you to be courageous and bold and vocalizing that because just know there are a lot of other women out there who feel the same way as you. Do not want and this is kind of piggybacking on when we start a little bit earlier so we're just going to get an even more hot water here the last thing we don't want to compete with men in the workplace. We just. The pinnacle of success is to be. Climbing the ladder to be thriving in your 9 to 5 everyday monday through friday maybe working some weekends you know traveling here and there whatever it takes like competing with men you know fighting for equal pay fighting for equalization fighting for that ceo role i mean we are like women are applauded whenever a woman makes it to any position it's the first time a woman is in that position is the pinnacle of womanhood and so it can be easy for us is not in any sort of ceo position i am not running any company i am not climbing any ladder except you know and so wow i'm a failure but that is not true and many of us are realizing that we may have been buying into that lie but we're kind of backtracking actually is that really what i want is that daily drive at 9 to 5 fighting in the workplace you know competing against men like is actually what i want and so many of us are stepping back and saying no that's not what i want but that doesn't mean i don't have passions again it doesn't mean i have these ambitions or even like business ideas or that you're not entrepreneurial or that you don't have certain gifts photography or music or other skills that god has given you you're just we're getting more creative we're saying we don't need to find our identity and competing against men in the workplace we can push our passions we can be there for our children we just were getting more creative and how we do it and i love that and it's cool to see like not even in the christian world but just like in the world and the people who are really appreciating the natural functions of a woman's body like chevrolet of you actually sent in and mentioned how you don't want to work this 9 to 5:00 job because it doesn't align with how you're made like on your monthly cycle and stuff and i started to hear like women who are becoming entrepreneur specifically so that they can kind of work more in line with. The natural energy and and be able to rest in times when your body is saying like hey you need to rest and instead of doing that as a weakness they're starting to view that as a beautiful strength and a beautiful unique aspect of their body and just even the ability when you get pregnant or if being able to say hey my body is doing something so amazing like this is really hard like creating another human you know and i can take a step back i don't have to continue hammering away at the pace and then you know get off my return it's like. We we should think differently but we're not the same as men and that's okay it doesn't mean we're weaker or less than but we can view our different a physical aspects of strength and tap into more of a schedule that i guess just aligns more with the way that god made us and so i'm really excited to see you know just women out there speaking up about this and saying hey. This corporate kind of. Job it's kind of a newer thing yeah it's like when the industrial revolution happened and then people started getting out of their homes working in factories working in businesses that kind of changed the whole function of our society and how people viewed work and so what i love about today is that we are in some way saying actually that's not really what we want and in fact that hasn't always been how things have worked and so we are stepping back and we're almost going back in time in some ways of getting more creative a figuring out how we can do the work that way and recognizing yes that men and women are different just like back down the exact same job that they were working in a way that really you know like their whole family was blessed because they were each functioning and roles that were really beneficial to their body shops were not necessarily getting back to the farm although many people are not supposed to but we are kind of recognizing you know it's okay to not be the same it's okay to lean into our different strengths as men and women and then actually encourage each other in that to a cherry color on and recognize the difference is are actually a really good thing so i'm kind of excited for the way things are turning right now absolutely and i want to hear from you like i love to hear either in a review on the podcast you know let us know. Which one you most resonated with say hey like yeah i totally agree with this i resonate with this and yes i am another woman who does not want those things you know let us know be bold you know kind of put yourself out there a little bit and say yeah i actually i agree with this and then if you follow us on any of our social media on instagram or on youtube find leave a comment letting us know what would you add to that list what's something that you was a christian woman. Biblical perspective a biblical worldview before i go i want to give a shout out to our patron so okay period.
